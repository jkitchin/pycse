This is a collection of examples of using python in the kinds of scientific and engineering computations I have used in classes and research. They are organized by topics.

I recommend the Continuum IO Anaconda python distribution (https://www.continuum.io). This distribution is free for academic use, and cheap otherwise. It is pretty complete in terms of mathematical, scientific and plotting modules. All of the examples in this book were created run with the Anaconda python distribution.

Python is a basic calculator out of the box. Here we consider the most basic mathematical operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and exponenetiation. we use the func:print to get the output. For now we consider integers and float numbers. An integer is a plain number like 0, 10 or -2345. A float number has a decimal in it. The following are all floats: 1.0, -9., and 3.56. Note the trailing zero is not required, although it is good style.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
print(2 + 4)
print(8.1 - 5)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: 6
: 3.0999999999999996


Multiplication is equally straightforward.
#+BEGIN_SRC python
print(5 * 4)
print(3.1 * 2)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: 20
: 6.2

Division is almost as straightforward, but we have to remember that integer division is not the same as float division. Let us consider float division first.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
print(4.0 / 2.0)
print(1.0 / 3.1)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: 2.0
: 0.3225806451612903

Now, consider the integer versions:

#+BEGIN_SRC python
print(4 / 2)
print(1 / 3)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: 2.0
: 0.3333333333333333

In Python3 division now is automatically float division. You can do integer division with the // operator like this.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
print(4 // 2)
print(1 // 3)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: 2
: 0

Exponentiation is also a basic math operation that python supports directly.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
print(3.**2)
print(3**2)
print(2**0.5)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: 9.0
: 9
: 1.4142135623730951

Other types of mathematical operations require us to import functionality from python libraries. We consider those in the next section.

The primary library we will consider is mod:numpy, which provides many mathematical functions, statistics as well as support for linear algebra. For a complete listing of the functions available, see http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/routines.math.html. We begin with the simplest functions.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
import numpy as np
print(np.sqrt(2))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: 1.41421356237

*** Exponential and logarithmic functions
Here is the exponential function.
#+BEGIN_SRC python
import numpy as np
print(np.exp(1))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: 2.71828182846

There are two logarithmic functions commonly used, the natural log function func:numpy.log and the base10 logarithm func:numpy.log10.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
import numpy as np
print(np.log(10))
print(np.log10(10))  # base10
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: 2.30258509299
: 1.0

There are many other intrinsic functions available in mod:numpy which we will eventually cover. First, we need to consider how to create our own functions.
** Creating your own functions

We can combine operations to evaluate complex equations. Consider the value of the equation $x^3 - \log(x)$ for the value $x=4.1$.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
import numpy as np
x = 3
print(x**3 - np.log(x))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: 25.9013877113

It would be tedious to type this out each time. Next, we learn how to express this equation as a new function, which we can call with different values.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
import numpy as np
def f(x):
    return x**3 - np.log(x)

print(f(3))
print(f(5.1))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: 25.9013877113
: 131.02175946

It may not seem like we did much there, but this is the foundation for solving equations in the future. Before we get to solving equations, we have a few more details to consider. Next, we consider evaluating functions on arrays of values.

Compare what's here to the [[http://matlab.cheme.cmu.edu/2011/08/09/where-its-i-got-two-turntables-and-a-microphone/][Matlab implementation. ]]

We often need to make functions in our codes to do things.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
def f(x):
    "return the inverse square of x"
    return 1.0 / x**2

print(f(3))
print(f([4,5]))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:

Note that functions are not automatically vectorized. That is why we see the error above. There are a few ways to achieve that. One is to "cast" the input variables to objects that support vectorized operations, such as numpy.array objects.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
import numpy as np

def f(x):
    "return the inverse square of x"
    x = np.array(x)
    return 1.0 / x**2

print(f(3))
print(f([4,5]))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: 0.111111111111
: [ 0.0625  0.04  ]

It is possible to have more than one variable.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
import numpy as np

def func(x, y):
    "return product of x and y"
    return x * y

print(func(2, 3))
print(func(np.array([2, 3]), np.array([3, 4])))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: 6
: [ 6 12]

You can define "lambda" functions, which are also known as inline or anonymous functions. The syntax is =lambda var:f(var)=. I think these are hard to read and discourage their use. Here is a typical usage where you have to define a simple function that is passed to another function, e.g. scipy.integrate.quad to perform an integral.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
from scipy.integrate import quad
print(quad(lambda x:x**3, 0 ,2))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: (4.0, 4.440892098500626e-14)

It is possible to nest functions inside of functions like this.
#+BEGIN_SRC python
def wrapper(x):
    a = 4
    def func(x, a):
	return a * x

    return func(x, a)

print(wrapper(4))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: 16

An alternative approach is to "wrap" a function, say to fix a parameter. You might do this so you can integrate the wrapped function, which depends on only a single variable, whereas the original function depends on two variables.
#+BEGIN_SRC python
def func(x, a):
	return a * x

def wrapper(x):
    a = 4
    return func(x, a)

print(wrapper(4))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: 16

Last example, defining a function for an ode

#+BEGIN_SRC python
from scipy.integrate import odeint
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

k = 2.2
def myode(y, t):
    "ode defining exponential growth"
    return k * y

y0 = 3
tspan = np.linspace(0,1)
y =  odeint(myode, y0, tspan)

plt.plot(tspan, y)
plt.xlabel('Time')
plt.ylabel('y')
plt.savefig('images/funcs-ode.png')
#+END_SRC

Python has some nice features in creating functions. You can create default values for variables, have optional variables and optional keyword variables.
In this function f(a,b), =a= and =b= are called positional arguments, and they are required, and must be provided in the same order as the function defines.

If we provide a default value for an argument, then the argument is called a keyword argument, and it becomes optional. You can combine positional arguments and keyword arguments, but positional arguments must come first. Here is an example.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
def func(a, n=2):
    "compute the nth power of a"
    return a**n

# three different ways to call the function
print(func(2))
print(func(2, 3))
print(func(2, n=4))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: 4
: 8
: 16

In the first call to the function, we only define the argument =a=, which is a mandatory, positional argument. In the second call, we define =a= and =n=, in the order they are defined in the function. Finally, in the third call, we define =a= as a positional argument, and =n= as a keyword argument.

If all of the arguments are optional, we can even call the function with no arguments. If you give arguments as positional arguments, they are used in the order defined in the function. If you use keyword arguments, the order is arbitrary.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
def func(a=1, n=2):
    "compute the nth power of a"
    return a**n

# three different ways to call the function
print(func())
print(func(2, 4))
print(func(n=4, a=2))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: 1
: 16
: 16

It is occasionally useful to allow an arbitrary number of arguments in a function. Suppose we want a function that can take an arbitrary number of positional arguments and return the sum of all the arguments. We use the syntax =*args= to indicate arbitrary positional arguments. Inside the function the variable =args= is a tuple containing all of the arguments passed to the function.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
def func(*args):
    sum = 0
    for arg in args:
	sum += arg
    return sum

print(func(1, 2, 3, 4))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: 10

A more "functional programming" version of the last function is given here. This is an advanced approach that is less readable to new users, but more compact and likely more efficient for large numbers of arguments.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
import functools, operator
def func(*args):
    return functools.reduce(operator.add, args)
print(func(1, 2, 3, 4))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: 10

It is possible to have arbitrary keyword arguments. This is a common pattern when you call another function within your function that takes keyword arguments. We use =**kwargs= to indicate that arbitrary keyword arguments can be given to the function. Inside the function, kwargs is variable containing a dictionary of the keywords and values passed in.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
def func(**kwargs):
    for kw in kwargs:
	print('{0} = {1}'.format(kw, kwargs[kw]))

func(t1=6, color='blue')
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: t1 = 6
: color = blue

A typical example might be:
#+BEGIN_SRC python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def myplot(x, y, fname=None, **kwargs):
    "make plot of x,y. save to fname if not None. Provide kwargs to plot."
    plt.plot(x, y, **kwargs)
    plt.xlabel('X')
    plt.ylabel('Y')
    plt.title('My plot')
    if fname:
	plt.savefig(fname)
    else:
	plt.show()

x = [1, 3, 4, 5]
y = [3, 6, 9, 12]

myplot(x, y, 'images/myfig.png', color='orange', marker='s')

# you can use a dictionary as kwargs
d = {'color':'magenta',
     'marker':'d'}

myplot(x, y, 'images/myfig2.png', **d)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:

[[./images/myfig.png]]
[[./images/myfig2.png]]

In that example we wrap the matplotlib plotting commands in a function, which we can call the way we want to, with arbitrary optional arguments. In this example, you cannot pass keyword arguments that are illegal to the plot command or you will get an error.

It is possible to combine all the options at once. I admit it is hard to imagine where this would be really useful, but it can be done!
#+BEGIN_SRC python
import numpy as np

def func(a, b=2, *args, **kwargs):
    "return a**b + sum(args) and print kwargs"
    for kw in kwargs:
	print('kw: {0} = {1}'.format(kw, kwargs[kw]))

    return a**b + np.sum(args)

print(func(2, 3, 4, 5, mysillykw='hahah'))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: kw: mysillykw = hahah
: 17

** Lambda Lambda Lambda

Is that some kind of fraternity? of anonymous functions? What is that!? There are many times where you need a callable, small function in python, and it is inconvenient to have to use =def= to create a named function. Lambda functions solve this problem. Let us look at some examples. First, we create a lambda function, and assign it to a variable. Then we show that variable is a function, and that we can call it with an argument.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
f = lambda x: 2*x
print(f)
print(f(2))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: <function <lambda> at 0x10067f378>
: 4

We can have more than one argument:
#+BEGIN_SRC python
f = lambda x,y: x + y
print(f)
print(f(2, 3))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: <function <lambda> at 0x10207f378>
: 5

And default arguments:

#+BEGIN_SRC python
f = lambda x, y=3: x + y
print(f)
print(f(2))
print(f(4, 1))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: <function <lambda> at 0x10077f378>
: 5
: 5

It is also possible to have arbitrary numbers of positional arguments. Here is an example that provides the sum of an arbitrary number of arguments.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
import functools, operator
f = lambda *x: functools.reduce(operator.add, x)
print(f)

print(f(1))
print(f(1, 2))
print(f(1, 2, 3))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: <function <lambda> at 0x10077f378>
: 1
: 3
: 6

You can also make arbitrary keyword arguments. Here we make a function that simply returns the kwargs as a dictionary. This feature may be helpful in passing kwargs to other functions.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
f = lambda **kwargs: kwargs

print(f(a=1, b=3))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: {'b': 3, 'a': 1}

Of course, you can combine these options. Here is a function with all the options.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
f = lambda a, b=4, *args, **kwargs: (a, b, args, kwargs)

print(f('required', 3, 'optional-positional', g=4))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: ('required', 3, ('optional-positional',), {'g': 4})

One of the primary limitations of lambda functions is they are limited to single expressions. They also do not have documentation strings, so it can be difficult to understand what they were written for later.

*** Applications of lambda functions

Lambda functions are used in places where you need a function, but may not want to define one using =def=. For example, say you want to solve the nonlinear equation $\sqrt{x} = 2.5$.
#+BEGIN_SRC python
from scipy.optimize import fsolve
import numpy as np

sol, = fsolve(lambda x: 2.5 - np.sqrt(x), 8)
print(sol)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: 6.25

Another time to use lambda functions is if you want to set a particular value of a parameter in a function. Say we have a function with an independent variable, $x$ and a parameter $a$, i.e. $f(x; a)$. If we want to find a solution $f(x; a) = 0$ for some value of $a$, we can use a lambda function to make a function of the single variable $x$. Here is a example.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
from scipy.optimize import fsolve
import numpy as np

def func(x, a):
    return a * np.sqrt(x) - 4.0

sol, = fsolve(lambda x: func(x, 3.2), 3)
print(sol)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: 1.5625


Any function that takes a function as an argument can use lambda functions. Here we use a lambda function that adds two numbers in the =reduce= function to sum a list of numbers.
#+BEGIN_SRC python
import functools as ft
print(ft.reduce(lambda x, y: x + y, [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: 10

We can evaluate the integral $\int_0^2 x^2 dx$ with a lambda function.
#+BEGIN_SRC python
from scipy.integrate import quad

print(quad(lambda x: x**2, 0, 2))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: (2.666666666666667, 2.960594732333751e-14)

*** Summary
Lambda functions can be helpful. They are never necessary. You can always define a function using =def=, but for some small, single-use functions, a lambda function could make sense. Lambda functions have some limitations, including that they are limited to a single expression, and they lack documentation strings.

Often, we will have a set of 1-D arrays, and we would like to construct a 2D array with those vectors as either the rows or columns of the array. This may happen because we have data from different sources we want to combine, or because we organize the code with variables that are easy to read, and then want to combine the variables. Here are examples of doing that to get the vectors as the columns.
#+BEGIN_SRC python
import numpy as np

a = np.array([1, 2, 3])
b = np.array([4, 5, 6])

print(np.column_stack([a, b]))

# this means stack the arrays vertically, e.g. on top of each other
print(np.vstack([a, b]).T)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: [[1 4]
:  [2 5]
:  [3 6]]
: [[1 4]
:  [2 5]
:  [3 6]]

Or rows:

#+BEGIN_SRC python
import numpy as np

a = np.array([1, 2, 3])
b = np.array([4, 5, 6])

print(np.row_stack([a, b]))

# this means stack the arrays vertically, e.g. on top of each other
print(np.vstack([a, b]))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: [[1 2 3]
:  [4 5 6]]
: [[1 2 3]
:  [4 5 6]]

The opposite operation is to extract the rows or columns of a 2D array into smaller arrays. We might want to do that to extract a row or column from a calculation for further analysis, or plotting for example. There are splitting functions in numpy. They are somewhat confusing, so we examine some examples. The numpy.hsplit command splits an array "horizontally". The best way to think about it is that the "splits" move horizontally across the array. In other words, you draw a vertical split, move over horizontally, draw another vertical split, etc... You must specify the number of splits that you want, and the array must be evenly divisible by the number of splits.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
import numpy as np

A = np.array([[1, 2, 3, 5],
	      [4, 5, 6, 9]])

# split into two parts
p1, p2 = np.hsplit(A, 2)
print(p1)
print(p2)

#split into 4 parts
p1, p2, p3, p4 = np.hsplit(A, 4)
print(p1)
print(p2)
print(p3)
print(p4)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_example
[[1 2]
 [4 5]]
[[3 5]
 [6 9]]
[[1]
 [4]]
[[2]
 [5]]
[[3]
 [6]]
[[5]
 [9]]
#+end_example

In the numpy.vsplit command the "splits" go "vertically" down the array. Note that the split commands return 2D arrays.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
import numpy as np

A = np.array([[1, 2, 3, 5],
	      [4, 5, 6, 9]])

# split into two parts
p1, p2 = np.vsplit(A, 2)
print(p1)
print(p2)
print(p2.shape)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: [[1 2 3 5]]
: [[4 5 6 9]]
: (1, 4)

An alternative approach is array unpacking. In this example, we unpack the array into two variables. The array unpacks by row.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
import numpy as np

A = np.array([[1, 2, 3, 5],
	      [4, 5, 6, 9]])

# split into two parts
p1, p2 = A
print(p1)
print(p2)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: [1 2 3 5]
: [4 5 6 9]

To get the columns, just transpose the array.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
import numpy as np

A = np.array([[1, 2, 3, 5],
	      [4, 5, 6, 9]])

# split into two parts
p1, p2, p3, p4 = A.T
print(p1)
print(p2)
print(p3)
print(p4)
print(p4.shape)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: [1 4]
: [2 5]
: [3 6]
: [5 9]
: (2,)

Note that now, we have 1D arrays.

You can also access rows and columns by indexing. We index an array by [row, column]. To get a row, we specify the row number, and all the columns in that row like this [row, :]. Similarly, to get a column, we specify that we want all rows in that column like this: [:, column]. This approach is useful when you only want a few columns or rows.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
import numpy as np

A = np.array([[1, 2, 3, 5],
	      [4, 5, 6, 9]])

# get row 1
print(A[1])
print(A[1, :])  # row 1, all columns

print(A[:, 2])  # get third column
print(A[:, 2].shape)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: [4 5 6 9]
: [4 5 6 9]
: [3 6]
: (2,)

Note that even when we specify a column, it is returned as a 1D array.

It is common to evaluate a function for a range of values. Let us consider the value of the function $f(x) = \cos(x)$ over the range of $0 < x < \pi$. We cannot consider every value in that range, but we can consider say 10 points in the range. The func:numpy.linspace conveniently creates an array of values.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
import numpy as np
print(np.linspace(0, np.pi, 10))

The main point of using the mod:numpy functions is that they work element-wise on elements of an array. In this example, we compute the $\cos(x)$ for each element of $x$.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
import numpy as np
x = np.linspace(0, np.pi, 10)
print(np.cos(x))

You can already see from this output that there is a root to the equation $\cos(x) = 0$, because there is a change in sign in the output. This is not a very convenient way to view the results; a graph would be better.  We use mod:matplotlib to make figures. Here is an example.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

x = np.linspace(0, np.pi, 10)
plt.plot(x, np.cos(x))
plt.xlabel('x')
plt.ylabel('cos(x)')
plt.savefig('images/plot-cos.png')
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:

[[./images/plot-cos.png]]

This figure illustrates graphically what the numbers above show. The function crosses zero at approximately $x = 1.5$. To get a more precise value, we must actually solve the function numerically. We use the function func:scipy.optimize.fsolve to do that. More precisely, we want to solve the equation $f(x) = \cos(x) = 0$. We create a function that defines that equation, and then use func:scipy.optimize.fsolve to solve it.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
from scipy.optimize import fsolve
import numpy as np

def f(x):
    return np.cos(x)

sol, = fsolve(f, x0=1.5) # the comma after sol makes it return a float
print(sol)
print(np.pi / 2)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:

We know the solution is \pi/2.

We often have a need to organize data into structures when solving problems.
*** the list
A list in python is data separated by commas in square brackets. Here, we might store the following data in a variable to describe the Antoine coefficients for benzene and the range they are relevant for [Tmin Tmax]. Lists are flexible, you can put anything in them, including other lists. We access the elements of the list by indexing:
#+BEGIN_SRC python
c = ['benzene', 6.9056, 1211.0, 220.79, [-16, 104]]
print(c[0])
print(c[-1])

a,b = c[0:2]
print(a,b)

name, A, B, C, Trange = c
print(Trange)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: benzene
: [-16, 104]
: benzene 6.9056
: [-16, 104]

Lists are "mutable", which means you can change their values.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
a = [3, 4, 5, [7, 8], 'cat']
print(a[0], a[-1])
a[-1] = 'dog'
print(a)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: 3 cat
: [3, 4, 5, [7, 8], 'dog']

*** tuples
Tuples are /immutable/; you cannot change their values. This is handy in cases where it is an error to change the value. A tuple is like a list but it is enclosed in parentheses.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
a = (3, 4, 5, [7, 8], 'cat')
print(a[0], a[-1])
a[-1] = 'dog'  # this is an error
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:

*** struct
Python does not exactly have the same thing as a struct in Matlab. You can achieve something like it by defining an empty class and then defining attributes of the class. You can check if an object has a particular attribute using hasattr.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
class Antoine:
    pass

a = Antoine()
a.name = 'benzene'
a.Trange = [-16, 104]

print(a.name)
print(hasattr(a, 'Trange'))
print(hasattr(a, 'A'))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: benzene
: True
: False

*** dictionaries
The analog of the containers.Map in Matlab is the dictionary in python. Dictionaries are enclosed in curly brackets, and are composed of key:value pairs.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
s = {'name':'benzene',
     'A':6.9056,
     'B':1211.0}

s['C'] = 220.79
s['Trange'] = [-16, 104]

print(s)
print(s['Trange'])
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: {'A': 6.9056, 'B': 1211.0, 'C': 220.79, 'name': 'benzene', 'Trange': [-16, 104]}
: [-16, 104]

#+BEGIN_SRC python
s = {'name':'benzene',
     'A':6.9056,
     'B':1211.0}

print('C' in s)
# default value for keys not in the dictionary
print(s.get('C', None))

print(s.keys())
print(s.values())
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: False
: None
: dict_keys(['B', 'name', 'A'])
: dict_values([1211.0, 'benzene', 6.9056])


*** Summary
We have examined four data structures in python. Note that none of these types are arrays/vectors with defined mathematical operations. For those, you need to consider numpy.array.

There are times where you have a lot of data in a vector or array and you want to extract a portion of the data for some analysis. For example, maybe you want to plot column 1 vs column 2, or you want the integral of data between x = 4 and x = 6, but your vector covers 0 < x < 10. Indexing is the way to do these things.

A key point to remember is that in python array/vector indices start at 0. Unlike Matlab, which uses parentheses to index a array, we use brackets in python.

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session

x = np.linspace(-np.pi, np.pi, 10)

We can select a range of elements too. The syntax a:b extracts the a^{th} to (b-1)^{th} elements. The syntax a:b:n starts at a, skips nelements up to the index b.

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session

Suppose we want the part of the vector where x > 2. We could do that by inspection, but there is a better way. We can create a mask of boolean (0 or 1) values that specify whether x > 2 or not, and then use the mask as an index.

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session
print(x[x > 2])
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:

You can use this to analyze subsections of data, for example to integrate the function y = sin(x) where x > 2.

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session
y = np.sin(x)

print(np.trapz( x[x > 2], y[x > 2]))
#+END_SRC

	      [4, 5, 6],
	      [7, 8, 9]])

Python does not have the linear assignment method like Matlab does. You can achieve something like that as follows. We flatten the array to 1D, do the linear assignment, and reshape the result back to the 2D array.

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session

c[2] = 34
b[:] = c.reshape(b.shape)

The 3d array is like book of 2D matrices. Each page has a 2D matrix on it. think about the indexing like this: (row, column, page)

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session
M = np.random.uniform(size=(3,3,3))  # a 3x3x3 array
print(M)
#+END_SRC

*** Summary
The most common place to use indexing is probably when a function returns an array with the independent variable in column 1 and solution in column 2, and you want to plot the solution. Second is when you want to analyze one part of the solution. There are also applications in numerical methods, for example in assigning values to the elements of a matrix or vector.
** Controlling the format of printed variables

This was first worked out in this [[http://matlab.cheme.cmu.edu/2011/10/06/sprintfing-to-the-finish/][original Matlab post]].

Often you will want to control the way a variable is printed. You may want to only show a few decimal places, or print in scientific notation, or embed the result in a string. Here are some examples of printing with no control over the format.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
a = 2./3
print(a)
print(1/3)
print(1./3.)
print(10.1)
print("Avogadro's number is ", 6.022e23,'.')
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: 0.6666666666666666
: 0.3333333333333333
: 0.3333333333333333
: 10.1
: Avogadro's number is  6.022e+23 .

There is no control over the number of decimals, or spaces around a printed number.

In python, we use the format function to control how variables are printed. With the format function you use codes like {/n/:format specifier} to indicate that a formatted string should be used. /n/ is the /n^{th}/ argument passed to format, and there are a variety of format specifiers. Here we examine how to format float numbers. The specifier has the general form "w.df" where w is the width of the field, and d is the number of decimals, and f indicates a float number. "1.3f" means to print a float number with 3 decimal places. Here is an example.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
print('The value of 1/3 to 3 decimal places is {0:1.3f}'.format(1./3.))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: The value of 1/3 to 3 decimal places is 0.333

In that example, the 0 in {0:1.3f} refers to the first (and only) argument to the format function. If there is more than one argument, we can refer to them like this:

#+BEGIN_SRC python
print('Value 0 = {0:1.3f}, value 1 = {1:1.3f}, value 0 = {0:1.3f}'.format(1./3., 1./6.))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: Value 0 = 0.333, value 1 = 0.167, value 0 = 0.333

Note you can refer to the same argument more than once, and in arbitrary order within the string.

Suppose you have a list of numbers you want to print out, like this:

#+BEGIN_SRC python
for x in [1./3., 1./6., 1./9.]:
    print('The answer is {0:1.2f}'.format(x))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: The answer is 0.33
: The answer is 0.17
: The answer is 0.11

The "g" format specifier is a general format that can be used to indicate a precision, or to indicate significant digits. To print a number with a specific number of significant digits we do this:

#+BEGIN_SRC python
print('{0:1.3g}'.format(1./3.))
print('{0:1.3g}'.format(4./3.))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: 0.333
: 1.33

We can also specify plus or minus signs. Compare the next two outputs.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
for x in [-1., 1.]:
    print('{0:1.2f}'.format(x))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: -1.00
: 1.00

You can see the decimals do not align. That is because there is a minus sign in front of one number. We can specify to show the sign for positive and negative numbers, or to pad positive numbers to leave space for positive numbers.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
for x in [-1., 1.]:
    print('{0:+1.2f}'.format(x)) # explicit sign

for x in [-1., 1.]:
    print('{0: 1.2f}'.format(x)) # pad positive numbers
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: -1.00
: +1.00
: -1.00
:  1.00

We use the "e" or "E" format modifier to specify scientific notation.
#+BEGIN_SRC python
import numpy as np
eps = np.finfo(np.double).eps
print(eps)
print('{0}'.format(eps))
print('{0:1.2f}'.format(eps))
print('{0:1.2e}'.format(eps))  #exponential notation
print('{0:1.2E}'.format(eps))  #exponential notation with capital E
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: 2.22044604925e-16
: 2.220446049250313e-16
: 0.00
: 2.22e-16
: 2.22E-16

As a float with 2 decimal places, that very small number is practically equal to 0.

We can even format percentages. Note you do not need to put the % in your string.
#+BEGIN_SRC python
print('the fraction {0} corresponds to {0:1.0%}'.format(0.78))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: the fraction 0.78 corresponds to 78%

There are many other options for formatting strings. See http://docs.python.org/2/library/string.html#formatstrings for a full specification of the options.

There are several more advanced ways to include formatted values in a string. In the previous case we examined replacing format specifiers by /positional/ arguments in the format command. We can instead use /keyword/ arguments.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
s = 'The {speed} {color} fox'.format(color='brown', speed='quick')
print(s)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: The quick brown fox

If you have a lot of variables already defined in a script, it is convenient to use them in string formatting with the locals command:

#+BEGIN_SRC python
speed = 'slow'
color= 'blue'

print('The {speed} {color} fox'.format(**locals()))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: The slow blue fox

If you want to access attributes on an object, you can specify them directly in the format identifier.
#+BEGIN_SRC python
class A:
    def __init__(self, a, b, c):
	self.a = a
	self.b = b
	self.c = c

mya = A(3,4,5)

print('a = {obj.a}, b = {obj.b}, c = {obj.c:1.2f}'.format(obj=mya))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: a = 3, b = 4, c = 5.00

You can access values of a dictionary:
#+BEGIN_SRC python
d = {'a': 56, "test":'woohoo!'}

print("the value of a in the dictionary is {obj[a]}. It works {obj[test]}".format(obj=d))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: the value of a in the dictionary is 56. It works woohoo!

And, you can access elements of a list. Note, however you cannot use -1 as an index in this case.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
L = [4, 5, 'cat']

print('element 0 = {obj[0]}, and the last element is {obj[2]}'.format(obj=L))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: element 0 = 4, and the last element is cat

There are three different ways to "print" an object. If an object has a __format__ function, that is the default used in the format command. It may be helpful to use the =str= or =repr= of an object instead. We get this with !s for =str= and !r for =repr=.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
class A:
    def __init__(self, a, b):
	self.a = a; self.b = b

    def __format__(self, format):
	s = 'a={{0:{0}}} b={{1:{0}}}'.format(format)
	return s.format(self.a, self.b)

    def __str__(self):
	return 'str: class A, a={0} b={1}'.format(self.a, self.b)

    def __repr__(self):
	return 'representing: class A, a={0}, b={1}'.format(self.a, self.b)

mya = A(3, 4)

print('{0}'.format(mya))    # uses __format__
print('{0!s}'.format(mya))  # uses __str__
print('{0!r}'.format(mya))  # uses __repr__
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: a=3 b=4
: str: class A, a=3 b=4
: representing: class A, a=3, b=4

This covers the majority of string formatting requirements I have come across. If there are more sophisticated needs, they can be met with various string templating python modules. the one I have used most is [[http://www.cheetahtemplate.org/][Cheetah]].

numpy has a function called numpy.diff() that is similar to the one found in matlab. It calculates the differences between the elements in your list, and returns a list that is one element shorter, which makes it unsuitable for plotting the derivative of a function.

Loops in python are pretty slow (relatively speaking) but they are usually trivial to understand. In this script we show some simple ways to construct derivative vectors using loops. It is implied in these formulas that the data points are equally spaced. If they are not evenly spaced, you need a different approach.

y = np.sin(x)

lets use a forward difference method:

** 2-point vs. 4-point numerical derivatives
[[index:derivative!4 point formula]]
If your data is very noisy, you will have a hard time getting good derivatives; derivatives tend to magnify noise. In these cases, you have to employ smoothing techniques, either implicitly by using a multipoint derivative formula, or explicitly by smoothing the data yourself, or taking the derivative of a function that has been fit to the data in the neighborhood you are interested in.

Here is an example of a 4-point centered difference of some noisy data:

One way to reduce the noise inherent in derivatives of noisy data is to fit a smooth function through the data, and analytically take the derivative of the curve. Polynomials are especially convenient for this. The challenge is to figure out what an appropriate polynomial order is. This requires judgment and experience.

You can see a third order polynomial is a reasonable fit here. There are only 6 data points here, so any higher order risks overfitting. Here is the comparison of the numerical derivative and the fitted derivative. We have "resampled" the fitted derivative to show the actual shape. Note the derivative appears to go through a maximum near t = 0.9. In this case, that is probably unphysical as the data is related to the consumption of species A in a reaction. The derivative should increase monotonically to zero. The increase is an artefact of the fitting process. End points are especially sensitive to this kind of error.

Visually this fit is about the same as a third order polynomial. Note the difference in the derivative though. We can readily extrapolate this derivative and get reasonable predictions of the derivative. That is true in this case because we fitted a physically relevant model for concentration vs. time for an irreversible, first order reaction.

Adapted from http://biomedicalcomputationreview.org/2/3/8.pdf and
http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=838250.838251

This posts introduces a novel way to numerically estimate the derivative
of a function that does not involve finite difference schemes. Finite
difference schemes are approximations to derivatives that become more and
more accurate as the step size goes to zero, except that as the step size
approaches the limits of machine accuracy, new errors can appear in the
approximated results. In the references above, a new way to compute the
derivative is presented that does not rely on differences!

The new way is: $f'(x) = \rm{imag}(f(x + i\Delta x)/\Delta x)$ where the
function $f$ is evaluated in imaginary space with a small $\Delta x$ in
the complex plane. The derivative is miraculously equal to the imaginary
part of the result in the limit of \(\Delta x \rightarrow 0\)!

This example comes from the first link. The derivative must be evaluated
using the chain rule.  We compare a forward difference, central
difference and complex-step derivative approximations.

#+BEGIN_SRC python

def f(x):   return np.sin(3*x)*np.log(x)

x = 0.7
h = 1e-7

# analytical derivative
dfdx_a = 3 * np.cos( 3*x)*np.log(x) + np.sin(3*x) / x

# finite difference
dfdx_fd = (f(x + h) - f(x))/h

# central difference
dfdx_cd = (f(x+h)-f(x-h))/(2*h)

# complex method
dfdx_I = np.imag(f(x + np.complex(0, h))/h)

print(dfdx_a)

These are all the same to 4 decimal places. The simple finite difference is the least accurate, and the central differences is practically the same as the complex number approach.

Let us use this method to verify the fundamental Theorem of Calculus, i.e.
to evaluate the derivative of an integral function. Let $f(x) =
\int\limits_1^{x^2} tan(t^3)dt$, and we now want to compute df/dx.
Of course, this can be done

Occasionally we need to define piecewise functions, e.g.

\begin{eqnarray}
f(x) &=&  0, x < 0 \\
     &=&  x, 0 <= x < 1\\
     &=&  2 - x, 1 < x <= 2\\
     &=&  0, x > 2
\end{eqnarray}

Today we examine a few ways to define a function like this. A simple way is to use conditional statements.
#+BEGIN_SRC python :session
def f1(x):
    if x < 0:
	return 0
    elif (x >= 0) & (x < 1):
	return x
    elif (x >= 1) & (x < 2):
	return 2.0 - x
    else:
	return 0

print(f1(-1))
#print(f1([0, 1, 2, 3]))  # does not work!
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: 0

This works, but the function is not vectorized, i.e. f([-1 0 2 3]) does not evaluate properly (it should give a list or array). You can get vectorized behavior by using list comprehension, or by writing your own loop. This does not fix all limitations, for example you cannot use the f1 function in the quad function to integrate it.

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

x = np.linspace(-1, 3)
y = [f1(xx) for xx in x]

Neither of those methods is convenient. It would be nicer if the function was vectorized, which would allow the direct notation f1([0, 1, 2, 3, 4]). A simple way to achieve this is through the use of logical arrays. We create logical arrays from comparison statements.

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session
def f2(x):
    'fully vectorized version'

    y = np.zeros(x.shape)

    y += ((x >= 1) & (x < 2)) * (2 - x)
    return y

A third approach is to use Heaviside functions. The Heaviside function is defined to be zero for x less than some value, and 0.5 for x=0, and 1 for x >= 0. If you can live with y=0.5 for x=0, you can define a vectorized function in terms of Heaviside functions like this.

In [[http://matlab.cheme.cmu.edu/2011/10/27/compute-pipe-diameter/][Post 1280]] we used a correlation for the Fanning friction factor for turbulent flow in a pipe. For laminar flow (Re < 3000), there is another correlation that is commonly used: $f_F = 16/Re$. Unfortunately, the correlations for laminar flow and turbulent flow have different values at the transition that should occur at Re = 3000. This discontinuity can cause a lot of problems for numerical solvers that rely on derivatives.

Today we examine a strategy for smoothly joining these two functions. First we define the two functions.

# this enables us to pass vectors to the function and get vectors as

You can see the discontinuity at Re = 3000. What we need is a method to join these two functions smoothly. We can do that with a sigmoid function.
Sigmoid functions

A sigmoid function smoothly varies from 0 to 1 according to the equation: $\sigma(x) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-(x-x0)/\alpha}}$. The transition is centered on $x0$, and $\alpha$ determines the width of the transition.

[[./images/smooth-transitions-sigma.png]]

If we have two functions, $f_1(x)$ and $f_2(x)$ we want to smoothly join, we do it like this: $f(x) = (1-\sigma(x))f_1(x) + \sigma(x)f_2(x)$. There is no formal justification for this form of joining, it is simply a mathematical convenience to get a numerically smooth function. Other functions besides the sigmoid function could also be used, as long as they smoothly transition from 0 to 1, or from 1 to zero.

You can see that away from the transition the combined function is practically equivalent to the original two functions. That is because away from the transition the sigmoid function is 0 or 1. Near Re = 3000 is a smooth transition from one curve to the other curve.

[[http://www.chem.mtu.edu/~fmorriso/DataCorrelationForSmoothPipes2010.pdf][Morrison]] derived a single function for the friction factor correlation over all Re: $f = \frac{0.0076\left(\frac{3170}{Re}\right)^{0.165}}{1 + \left(\frac{3171}{Re}\right)^{7.0}} + \frac{16}{Re}$. Here we show the comparison with the approach used above. The friction factor differs slightly at high Re, because Morrison's is based on the Prandlt correlation, while the work here is based on the Nikuradse correlation. They are similar, but not the same.

*** Summary

The approach demonstrated here allows one to smoothly join two discontinuous functions that describe physics in different regimes, and that must transition over some range of data. It should be emphasized that the method has no physical basis, it simply allows one to create a mathematically smooth function, which could be necessary for some optimizers or solvers to work.

Suppose we have a parameter that has two different values depending on the value of a dimensionless number. For example when the dimensionless number is much less than 1, x = 2/3, and when x is much greater than 1, x = 1. We desire a smooth transition from 2/3 to 1  as a function of x to avoid discontinuities in functions of x. We will adapt the smooth transitions between functions to be a smooth transition between constants.

This is a nice trick to get an analytical function with continuous derivatives for a transition between two constants. You could have the transition occur at a value other than D = 1, as well by changing the argument to the exponential function.

What is the difference between quad and trapz? The short answer is that quad integrates functions (via a function handle) using numerical quadrature, and trapz performs integration of arrays of data using the trapezoid method.

Let us look at some examples. We consider the example of computing $\int_0^2 x^3 dx$. the analytical integral is $1/4 x^4$, so we know the integral evaluates to 16/4 = 4. This will be our benchmark for comparison to the numerical methods.

We use the scipy.integrate.quad command  to evaluate this $\int_0^2 x^3 dx$.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
from scipy.integrate import quad

ans, err = quad(lambda x: x**3, 0, 2)
print(ans)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: 4.0

you can also define a function for the integrand.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
from scipy.integrate import quad

def integrand(x):
    return x**3

ans, err = quad(integrand, 0, 2)
print(ans)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: 4.0

*** Numerical data integration

if we had numerical data like this, we use trapz to integrate it

#+BEGIN_SRC python
import numpy as np

x = np.array([0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2])
y = x**3

i2 = np.trapz(y, x)

error = (i2 - 4) / 4

print(i2, error)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: 4.25 0.0625

Note the integral of these vectors is greater than 4! You can see why here.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
x = np.array([0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2])
y = x**3

x2 = np.linspace(0, 2)
y2 = x2**3

plt.plot(x, y, label='5 points')
plt.plot(x2, y2, label='50 points')
plt.legend()
plt.savefig('images/quad-1.png')
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:

[[./images/quad-1.png]]

The trapezoid method is overestimating the area significantly. With more points, we get much closer to the analytical value.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
import numpy as np

x2 = np.linspace(0, 2, 100)
y2 = x2**3

print(np.trapz(y2, x2))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:

*** Combining numerical data with quad

You might want to combine numerical data with the quad function if you want to perform integrals easily. Let us say you are given this data:

x = [0 0.5 1 1.5 2];
y = [0    0.1250    1.0000    3.3750    8.0000];

and you want to integrate this from x = 0.25 to 1.75. We do not have data in those regions, so some interpolation is going to be needed. Here is one approach.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
from scipy.interpolate import interp1d
from scipy.integrate import quad
import numpy as np

x = [0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2]
y = [0,    0.1250,    1.0000,    3.3750,    8.0000]

f = interp1d(x, y)

# numerical trapezoid method
xfine = np.linspace(0.25, 1.75)
yfine = f(xfine)
print(np.trapz(yfine, xfine))

# quadrature with interpolation
ans, err = quad(f, 0.25, 1.75)
print(ans)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: 2.53199187838
: 2.5312499999999987

These approaches are very similar, and both rely on linear interpolation. The second approach is simpler, and uses fewer lines of code.

*** Summary

trapz and quad are functions for getting integrals. Both can be used with numerical data if interpolation is used. The syntax for the quad and trapz function is different in scipy than in Matlab.

Finally, see this [[http://matlab.cheme.cmu.edu/2011/08/30/solving-integral-equations/][post]] for an example of solving an integral equation using quad and fsolve.

Polynomials can be represented as a list of coefficients. For example, the polynomial $4*x^3 + 3*x^2 -2*x + 10 = 0$ can be represented as [4, 3, -2, 10]. Here are some ways to create a polynomial object, and evaluate it.

#+BEGIN_SRC python

numpy makes it easy to get the derivative and integral of a polynomial.

Consider: $y = 2x^2 - 1$. We know the derivative is $4x$. Here we compute the derivative and evaluate it at x=4.

#+BEGIN_SRC python

The integral of the previous polynomial is $\frac{2}{3} x^3 - x + c$. We assume $C=0$. Let us compute the integral $\int_2^4 2x^2 - 1 dx$.

#+BEGIN_SRC python

p = np.poly1d([2, 0, -1])
p2 = np.polyint(p)

One reason to use polynomials is the ease of finding all of the roots using numpy.roots.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
import numpy as np
print(np.roots([2, 0, -1])) # roots are +- sqrt(2)

# note that imaginary roots exist, e.g. x^2 + 1 = 0 has two roots, +-i
p = np.poly1d([1, 0, 1])
print(np.roots(p))

There are applications of polynomials in thermodynamics. The van der waal equation is a cubic polynomial $f(V) = V^3 - \frac{p n b + n R T}{p} V^2 + \frac{n^2 a}{p}V - \frac{n^3 a b}{p} = 0$, where $a$ and $b$ are constants, $p$ is the pressure, $R$ is the gas constant, $T$ is an absolute temperature and $n$ is the number of moles. The roots of this equation tell you the volume of the gas at those conditions.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
import numpy as np
# numerical values of the constants
a = 3.49e4
b = 1.45
p = 679.7   # pressure in psi
T = 683     # T in Rankine
n = 1.136   # lb-moles
R = 10.73   # ft^3 * psi /R / lb-mol

ppar = [1.0, -(p*n*b+n*R*T)/p, n**2*a/p,  -n**3*a*b/p];
print(np.roots(ppar))

Note that only one root is real (and even then, we have to interpret 0.j as not being imaginary. Also, in a cubic polynomial, there can only be two imaginary roots). In this case that means there is only one phase present.

*** Summary
Polynomials in numpy are even better than in Matlab, because you get a polynomial object that acts just like a function. Otherwise, they are functionally equivalent.

The coefficients are orders of magnitude apart in size. This should make you nervous, because the roots of this equation are between 1-20, but there are numbers here that are O(19). This is likely to make any rounding errors in the number representations very significant, and may lead to issues with accuracy of the solution. Let us explore that.

We will get the roots using numpy.roots.

The roots are not exact. Even more to the point, the polynomial does not evaluate to zero at the calculated roots! Something is clearly wrong here. The polynomial function is fine, and it does evaluate to zero at the known roots which are integers. It is subtle, but up to that point, we are using only integers, which can be represented exactly. The roots function is evidently using some float math, and the floats are not the same as the integers.

If we simply change the roots to floats, and reevaluate our polynomial, we get dramatically different results.

Now you can see the issue. Many of these numbers are identical in integer and float form, but some of them are not. The integer /cannot/ be exactly represented as a float, and there is a difference in the representations. It is a small difference compared to the magnitude, but these kinds of differences get raised to high powers, and become larger. You may wonder why I used "0:<30s>" to print the integer? That is because =pj= in that loop is an object from sympy, which prints as a string.

This is a famous, and well known problem that is especially bad for this case. This illustrates that you cannot simply rely on what a computer tells you the answer is, without doing some critical thinking about the problem and the solution. Especially in problems where there are coefficients that vary by many orders of magnitude you should be cautious.

There are a few interesting webpages on this topic, which inspired me to work this out in python. These webpages go into more detail on this problem, and provide additional insight into the sensitivity of the solutions to the polynomial coefficients.

See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trapezoidal_rule

$$\int_a^b f(x) dx \approx \frac{1}{2}\displaystyle\sum\limits_{k=1}^N(x_{k+1}-x_k)(f(x_{k+1}) + f(x_k))$$

Let us compute the integral of sin(x) from x=0 to $\pi$. To approximate the integral, we need to divide the interval from $a$ to $b$ into $N$ intervals. The analytical answer is 2.0.

We will use this example to illustrate the difference in performance between loops and vectorized operations in python.

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session
import numpy as np
import time

a = 0.0; b = np.pi;
N = 1000; # this is the number of intervals

h = (b - a)/N; # this is the width of each interval
x = np.linspace(a, b, N)
y = np.sin(x); # the sin function is already vectorized

t0 = time.time()
f = 0.0
for k in range(len(x) - 1):
    f += 0.5 * ((x[k+1] - x[k]) * (y[k+1] + y[k]))

tf = time.time() - t0
print('time elapsed = {0} sec'.format(tf))

print(f)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: time elapsed = 0.03262186050415039 sec

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session
t0 = time.time()
Xk = x[1:-1] - x[0:-2] # vectorized version of (x[k+1] - x[k])
Yk = y[1:-1] + y[0:-2] # vectorized version of (y[k+1] + y[k])

f = 0.5 * np.sum(Xk * Yk) # vectorized version of the loop above
tf = time.time() - t0
print('time elapsed = {0} sec'.format(tf))

print(f)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: time elapsed = 0.03238797187805176 sec
: 1.99999340709

In the last example, there may be loop buried in the sum command. Let us do one final method, using linear algebra, in a single line. The key to understanding this is to recognize the sum is just the result of a dot product of the x differences and y sums.

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session
t0 = time.time()
f = 0.5 * np.dot(Xk, Yk)
tf = time.time() - t0
print('time elapsed = {0} sec'.format(tf))

print(f)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: time elapsed = 0.012599945068359375 sec

The loop method is straightforward to code, and looks alot like the formula that defines the trapezoid method. the vectorized methods are not as easy to read, and take fewer lines of code to write. However, the vectorized methods are much faster than the loop, so the loss of readability could be worth it for very large problems.

The times here are considerably slower than in Matlab. I am not sure if that is a totally fair comparison. Here I am running python through emacs, which may result in slower performance. I also used a very crude way of timing the performance which lumps some system performance in too.

A more accurate numerical integration than the trapezoid method is [[http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.integrate.simps.html][Simpson's rule]]. The syntax is similar to trapz, but the method is in scipy.integrate.

#+BEGIN_SRC python

print('trapz = {0} ({1:%} error)'.format(t, (t - a)/a))

*Problem statement*

find the integral of a function f(x) from a to b i.e.

$$\int_a^b f(x) dx$$

In python we use numerical quadrature to achieve this with the scipy.integrate.quad command.

as a specific example, lets integrate

$$y=x^2$$

from x=0 to x=1. You should be able to work out that the answer is 1/3.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
from scipy.integrate import quad

def integrand(x):
    return x**2

ans, err = quad(integrand, 0, 1)
print(ans)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: 0.33333333333333337

*** double integrals

we use the scipy.integrate.dblquad command

Integrate $f(x,y)=y sin(x)+x cos(y)$ over

$\pi <= x <= 2\pi$

$0 <= y <= \pi$

i.e.

$\int_{x=\pi}^{2\pi}\int_{y=0}^{\pi}y sin(x)+x cos(y)dydx$

The syntax in dblquad is a bit more complicated than in Matlab. We have to provide callable functions for the range of the y-variable. Here they are constants, so we create lambda functions that return the constants. Also, note that the order of arguments in the integrand is different than in Matlab.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
from scipy.integrate import dblquad
import numpy as np

def integrand(y, x):
    'y must be the first argument, and x the second.'
    return y * np.sin(x) + x * np.cos(y)

ans, err = dblquad(integrand, np.pi, 2*np.pi,
		   lambda x: 0,
		   lambda x: np.pi)
print (ans)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: -9.869604401089358

we use the tplquad command  to integrate $f(x,y,z)=y sin(x)+z cos(x)$ over the region

$0 <= x <= \pi$

$0 <= y <= 1$

$-1 <= z <= 1$

#+BEGIN_SRC python
from scipy.integrate import tplquad
import numpy as np

def integrand(z, y, x):
    return y * np.sin(x) + z * np.cos(x)

ans, err = tplquad(integrand,
		   0, np.pi,  # x limits
		   lambda x: 0,
		   lambda x: 1, # y limits
		   lambda x,y: -1,
		   lambda x,y: 1) # z limits

print (ans)

*** Summary
scipy.integrate offers the same basic functionality as Matlab does. The syntax differs significantly for these simple examples, but the use of functions for the limits enables freedom to integrate over non-constant limits.

A common need in engineering calculations is to integrate an equation over some range to determine the total change. For example, say we know the volumetric flow changes with time according to $d\nu/dt = \alpha t$, where $\alpha = 1$ L/min and we want to know how much liquid flows into a tank over 10 minutes if the volumetric flowrate is $\nu_0 = 5$ L/min at $t=0$. The answer to that question is the value of this integral: $V = \int_0^{10} \nu_0 + \alpha t dt$.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
import scipy
from scipy.integrate import quad

nu0 = 5     # L/min
alpha = 1.0 # L/min
def integrand(t):
    return nu0 + alpha * t

t0 = 0.0
tfinal = 10.0
V, estimated_error = quad(integrand, t0, tfinal)
print('{0:1.2f} L flowed into the tank over 10 minutes'.format(V))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: 100.00 L flowed into the tank over 10 minutes

That is all there is too it!
** Function integration by the Romberg method

An alternative to the scipy.integrate.quad function is the [[http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.integrate.romberg.html][Romberg method]]. This method is not likely to be more accurate than quad, and it does not give you an error estimate.
#+BEGIN_SRC python

Float numbers (i.e. the ones with decimals) cannot be perfectly represented in a computer. This can lead to some artifacts when you have to compare float numbers that on paper should be the same, but in silico are not. Let us look at some examples. In this example, we do some simple math that should result in an answer of 1, and then see if the answer is "equal" to one.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
print(3.0 * (1.0/3.0))
print(1.0 == 3.0 * (1.0/3.0))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: 1.0
: True

Everything looks fine. Now, consider this example.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
print(49.0 * (1.0/49.0))
print(1.0 == 49.0 * (1.0/49.0))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: 0.9999999999999999
: False

The first line shows the result is not 1.0, and the equality fails!
You can see here why the equality statement fails. We will print the two numbers to sixteen decimal places.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
print('{0:1.16f}'.format(49.0 * (1.0 / 49.0) ))
print('{0:1.16f}'.format(1.0))
print(1 - 49.0 * (1.0 / 49.0))
#+END_SRC

: 1.0000000000000000
: 1.1102230246251565e-16

The two numbers actually are not equal to each other because of float math. They are /very, very/ close to each other, but not the same.

This leads to the idea of asking if two numbers are equal to each other within some tolerance. The question of what tolerance to use requires thought. Should it be an absolute tolerance? a relative tolerance? How large should the tolerance be? We will use the distance between 1 and the nearest floating point number (this is =eps= in Matlab). =numpy= can tell us this number with the =np.spacing= command.

Below, we implement a comparison function from [[http://dx.doi.org/10.1107/S010876730302186X][doi:10.1107/S010876730302186X]] that allows comparisons with tolerance.

    'x < y'
    return x < (y - epsilon)

As you can see, float comparisons can be tricky. You have to give a lot of thought to how to make the comparisons, and the functions shown above are not the only way to do it. You need to build in testing to make sure your comparisons are doing what you want.

Numpy has some gotcha features for linear algebra purists. The first is that a 1d array is neither a row, nor a column vector. That is, $a$ = $a^T$ if $a$ is a 1d array. That means you can take the dot product of $a$ with itself, without transposing the second argument. This would not be allowed in Matlab.

Compare the previous behavior with this 2d array. In this case, you cannot take the dot product of $b$ with itself, because the dimensions are incompatible. You must transpose the second argument to make it dimensionally consistent. Also, the result of the dot product is not a simple scalar, but a 1 \times 1 array.

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session
b = np.array([[0, 1, 2]])

In the next example,  we have a 3 element vector and a 4 element vector. We convert $b$ to a 2D array with np.newaxis, and compute the outer product of the two arrays. The result is a 4 \times 3 array.
#+BEGIN_SRC python :session

These concepts are known in numpy as array broadcasting. See http://www.scipy.org/EricsBroadcastingDoc and http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/user/basics.broadcasting.html for more details.

These are points to keep in mind, as the operations do not strictly follow the conventions of linear algebra, and may be confusing at times.

It can be useful to confirm there should be a solution, e.g. that the equations are all independent. The matrix rank will tell us that. Note that numpy:rank does not give you the matrix rank, but rather the number of dimensions of the array. We compute the rank by computing the number of singular values of the matrix that are greater than zero, within a prescribed tolerance. We use the =numpy.linalg.svd= function for that. In Matlab you would use the rref command to see if there are any rows that are all zero, but this command does not exist in numpy. That command does not have practical use in numerical linear algebra and has not been implemented.

with a function.

** Sums products and linear algebra notation - avoiding loops where possible

[[http://matlab.cheme.cmu.edu/2012/01/03/sums-products-and-linear-algebra-notation-avoiding-loops-where-possible/][Matlab comparison]]

Today we examine some methods of linear algebra that allow us to
avoid writing explicit loops in Matlab for some kinds of
mathematical operations.

Consider the operation on two vectors $\bf{a}$
and $\bf{b}$.


 $$y=\sum\limits_{i=1}^n a_ib_i$$

a = [1 2 3 4 5]

b = [3 6 8 9 10]

*** Old-fashioned way with a loop
We can compute this with a loop, where you initialize y, and then
 add the product of the ith elements of a and b to y in each
iteration of the loop. This is known to be slow for large vectors

#+BEGIN_SRC python
a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
b = [3, 6, 8, 9, 10]

sum = 0
for i in range(len(a)):
    sum = sum + a[i] * b[i]
print(sum)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: 125

This is an old fashioned style of coding. A more modern, pythonic approach is:
#+BEGIN_SRC python
a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
b = [3, 6, 8, 9, 10]

sum = 0
for x,y in zip(a,b):
    sum += x * y
print(sum)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: 125

*** The numpy approach
The most compact method is to use the  methods in numpy.
#+BEGIN_SRC python
import numpy as np

a = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
b = np.array([3, 6, 8, 9, 10])

print(np.sum(a * b))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: 125

*** Matrix algebra approach.
The operation defined above is actually a dot product. We an directly compute the dot product in numpy. Note that with 1d arrays, python knows what to do and does not require any transpose operations.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
import numpy as np

a = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
b = np.array([3, 6, 8, 9, 10])

print(np.dot(a, b))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: 125

*** Another example
Consider $y = \sum\limits_{i=1}^n w_i x_i^2$. This operation is like a weighted sum of squares.
The old-fashioned way to do this is with a loop.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
w = [0.1, 0.25, 0.12, 0.45, 0.98];
x = [9, 7, 11, 12, 8];
y = 0
for wi, xi in zip(w,x):
   y += wi * xi**2
print(y)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: 162.39

Compare this to the more modern numpy approach.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
import numpy as np
w = np.array([0.1, 0.25, 0.12, 0.45, 0.98])
x = np.array([9, 7, 11, 12, 8])
y = np.sum(w * x**2)
print(y)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: 162.39

We can also express this in matrix algebra form. The operation is equivalent to $y = \vec{x} \cdot D_w \cdot \vec{x}^T$ where $D_w$ is a diagonal matrix with the weights on the diagonal.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
import numpy as np
w = np.array([0.1, 0.25, 0.12, 0.45, 0.98])
x = np.array([9, 7, 11, 12, 8])
y = np.dot(x, np.dot(np.diag(w), x))
print(y)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: 162.39

This last form avoids explicit loops and sums, and relies on fast linear algebra routines.

*** Last example
Consider the sum of the product of three vectors. Let $y = \sum\limits_{i=1}^n w_i x_i y_i$. This is like a weighted sum of products.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
import numpy as np

w = np.array([0.1, 0.25, 0.12, 0.45, 0.98])
x = np.array([9, 7, 11, 12, 8])
y = np.array([2, 5, 3, 8, 0])

print(np.sum(w * x * y))
print(np.dot(w, np.dot(np.diag(x), y)))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: 57.71
: 57.71


*** Summary
We showed examples of the following equalities between traditional
sum notations and linear algebra


 $$\bf{a}\bf{b}=\sum\limits_{i=1}^n a_ib_i$$

 $$\bf{x}\bf{D_w}\bf{x^T}=\sum\limits_{i=1}^n w_ix_i^2$$


 $$\bf{x}\bf{D_w}\bf{y^T}=\sum\limits_{i=1}^n w_i x_i y_i$$

These relationships enable one to write the sums as a single line of
python code, which utilizes fast linear algebra subroutines, avoids
the construction of slow loops, and reduces the opportunity for
errors in the code. Admittedly, it introduces the opportunity for
new types of errors, like using the wrong relationship, or linear
algebra errors due to matrix size mismatches.

Occasionally we have a set of vectors and we need to determine whether the vectors are linearly independent of each other. This may be necessary to determine if the vectors form a basis, or to determine how many independent equations there are, or to determine how many independent reactions there are.

Matlab provides a rank command which gives you the number of singular values greater than some tolerance. The numpy.rank function, unfortunately, does not do that. It returns the number of dimensions in the array. We will just compute the rank from singular value decomposition.

The default tolerance used in Matlab is max(size(A))*eps(norm(A)). Let us break that down. eps(norm(A)) is the positive distance from abs(X) to the next larger in magnitude floating point number of the same precision as X. Basically, the smallest significant number. We multiply that by the size of A, and take the largest number. We have to use some judgment in what the tolerance is, and what "zero" means.

A = np.row_stack([v1, v2, v3])

# matlab definition

TOLERANCE = max(eps * np.array(A.shape))

U, s, V = np.linalg.svd(A)
print(s)

TOLERANCE = 1e-14

You can see if you choose too small a TOLERANCE, nothing looks like zero. the result with TOLERANCE=1e-14 suggests the rows are not linearly independent. Let us show that one row can be expressed as a linear combination of the other rows.

The number of rows is greater than the rank, so these vectors are not
independent. Let's demonstrate that one vector can be defined as a linear
combination of the other two vectors. Mathematically we represent this
as:

$x_1 \mathit{v1} + x_2 \mathit{v2} = v3$

or

$[x_1 x_2][v1; v2] = v3$

This is not the usual linear algebra form of Ax = b. To get there, we
transpose each side of the equation to get:

 [v1.T v2.T][x_1; x_2] = v3.T

which is the form Ax = b. We solve it in a least-squares sense.

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session
A = np.column_stack([v1, v2])
x = np.linalg.lstsq(A, v3)

This shows that v3 = 2*v1 - 3*v2

You can tell by inspection the rank is 2 because there are no near-zero singular values.

*** Near deficient rank

the rank command roughly works in the following way: the matrix is converted to a reduced row echelon form, and then the number of rows that are not all equal to zero are counted. Matlab uses a tolerance to determine what is equal to zero. If there is uncertainty in the numbers, you may have to define what zero is, e.g. if the absolute value of a number is less than 1e-5, you may consider that close enough to be zero. The default tolerance is usually very small, of order 1e-15. If we believe that any number less than 1e-5 is practically equivalent to zero, we can use that information to compute the rank like this.

import numpy as np

A = [[1, 2, 3],

The following reactions are proposed in the hydrogenation of bromine:

Let this be our species vector: v = [H2 H Br2 Br HBr].T

the reactions are then defined by M*v where M is a stoichometric matrix in which each row represents a reaction with negative stoichiometric coefficients for reactants, and positive stoichiometric coefficients for products. A stoichiometric coefficient of 0 is used for species not participating in the reaction.

6 reactions are given, but the rank of the matrix is only 3. so there
are only three independent reactions. You can see that reaction 6 is just
the opposite of reaction 2, so it is clearly not independent. Also,
reactions 3 and 5 are just the reverse of each other, so one of them can
also be eliminated. finally, reaction 4 is equal to reaction 1 minus
reaction 3.

There are many possible independent reactions. In the code above, we use sympy to put the matrix into reduced row echelon form, which enables us to identify three independent reactions, and shows that three rows are all zero, i.e. they are not independent of the other three reactions. The choice of independent reactions is not unique.

** Reduced row echelon form

There is a nice discussion [[http://numpy-discussion.10968.n7.nabble.com/Reduced-row-echelon-form-td16486.html][here]] on why there is not a rref command in numpy, primarily because one rarely actually needs it in linear algebra. Still, it is so often taught, and it helps visually see what the rank of a matrix is that I wanted to examine ways to get it.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
import numpy as np
from sympy import Matrix

A = np.array([[3, 2, 1],
	      [2, 1, 1],
	      [6, 2, 4]])

rA, pivots =  Matrix(A).rref()

This rref form is a bit different than you might get from doing it by hand. The rows are also normalized.

Based on this, we conclude the $A$ matrix has a rank of 2 since one row of the reduced form contains all zeros. That means the determinant will be zero, and it should not be possible to compute the inverse of the matrix, and there should be no solution to linear equations of $A x = b$. Let us check it out.

There are "solutions", but there are a couple of red flags that should catch your eye. First, the determinant is within machine precision of zero. Second the elements of the inverse are all "large". Third, the solutions are all "large". All of these are indications of or artifacts of numerical imprecision.

[[index:LU decomposition,determinant]]
There are a few properties of a matrix that can make it easy to compute determinants.

1. The determinant of a triangular matrix is the product of the elements on the diagonal.
2. The determinant of a permutation matrix is (-1)**n where n is the number of permutations. Recall a permutation matrix is a matrix with a one in each row, and column, and zeros everywhere else.
3. The determinant of a product of matrices is equal to the product of the determinant of the matrices.

The LU decomposition computes three matrices such that $A = P L U$. Thus, $\det A = \det P \det L \det U$. $L$ and $U$ are triangular, so we just need to compute the product of the diagonals. $P$ is not triangular, but if the elements of the diagonal are not 1, they will be zero, and then there has been a swap. So we simply subtract the sum of the diagonal from the length of the diagonal and then subtract 1 to get the number of swaps.

#+BEGIN_SRC python

A = np.array([[6, 2, 3],

If the built in linear algebra functions in numpy and scipy do not meet your needs, it is often possible to directly call lapack functions. Here we call a function to solve a set of complex linear equations. The lapack function for this is ZGBSV. The description of this function (http://linux.die.net/man/l/zgbsv) is:

ZGBSV computes the solution to a complex system of linear equations A * X = B, where A is a band matrix of order N with KL subdiagonals and KU superdiagonals, and X and B are N-by-NRHS matrices. The LU decomposition with partial pivoting and row interchanges is used to factor A as A = L * U, where L is a product of permutation and unit lower triangular matrices with KL subdiagonals, and U is upper triangular with KL+KU superdiagonals. The factored form of A is then used to solve the system of equations A * X = B.

The python signature is (http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.linalg.lapack.zgbsv.html#scipy.linalg.lapack.zgbsv):

lub,piv,x,info = zgbsv(kl,ku,ab,b,[overwrite_ab,overwrite_b])

Some points of discussion.

1. Kind of painful! but, nevertheless, possible. You have to do a lot more work figuring out the dimensions of the problem, how to setup the problem, keeping track of indices, etc...

But, one day it might be helpful to know this can be done, e.g. to debug an installation, to validate an approach against known results, etc...

* Nonlinear algebra
Nonlinear algebra problems are typically solved using an iterative process that terminates when the solution is found within a specified tolerance. This process is hidden from the user. The canonical standard form to solve is $f(X) = 0$.

** Know your tolerance

Now let us solve the equation. It looks like an answer is near C=500.

Occasionally we have integral equations we need to solve in engineering problems, for example, the volume of plug flow reactor can be defined by this equation: $V = \int_{Fa(V=0)}^{Fa} \frac{1}{r_a} dFa$ where $r_a$ is the rate law. Suppose we know the reactor volume is 100 L, the inlet molar flow of A is 1 mol/L, the volumetric flow is 10 L/min, and $r_a = -k Ca$, with $k=0.23$ 1/min. What is the exit molar flow rate? We need to solve the following equation:

$$100 = \int_{Fa(V=0)}^{Fa} \frac{1}{-k Fa/\nu} dFa$$

We start by creating a function handle that describes the integrand. We can use this function in the quad command to evaluate the integral.

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session

from scipy.integrate import quad

k = 0.23

def func(Fa):
    integral,err = quad(integrand, Fao, Fa)
    return 100.0 - integral

vfunc = np.vectorize(func)
#+END_SRC


#+RESULTS:

We will need an initial guess, so we make a plot of our function to get an idea.

Now we can see a zero is near Fa = 0.1, so we proceed to solve the equation.

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session
Fa_guess = 0.1
Fa_exit, = fsolve(vfunc, Fa_guess)
print('The exit concentration is {0:1.2f} mol/L'.format(Fa_exit / nu))

We seek the solution to the following nonlinear equations:

$2 + x + y - x^2 + 8 x y + y^3 = 0$

$1 + 2x - 3y + x^2 + xy - y e^x = 0$

In principle this is easy, we simply need some initial guesses and a nonlinear solver. The challenge here is what would you guess? There could be many solutions. The equations are implicit, so it is not easy to graph them, but let us give it a shot, starting on the x range -5 to 5. The idea is set a value for x, and then solve for y in each equation.

You can see there is a solution near x = -1, y = 0, because both functions equal zero there. We can even use that guess with fsolve. It is disappointly easy! But, keep in mind that in 3 or more dimensions, you cannot perform this visualization, and another method could be required.

We explore a method that bypasses this problem today. The principle is to introduce a new variable, $\lambda$, which will vary from 0 to 1. at $\lambda=0$ we will have a simpler equation, preferably a linear one, which can be easily solved, or which can be analytically solved. At $\lambda=1$, we have the original equations. Then, we create a system of differential equations that start at the easy solution, and integrate from $\lambda=0$ to $\lambda=1$, to recover the final solution.

We rewrite the equations as:

$f(x,y) = (2 + x + y) + \lambda(- x^2 + 8 x y + y^3) = 0$

$g(x,y) = (1 + 2x - 3y) + \lambda(x^2 + xy - y e^x) = 0$

Now, at $\lambda=0$ we have the simple linear equations:

$x + y = -2$

$2x - 3y = -1$

These equations are trivial to solve:

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session
x0 = np.linalg.solve([[1., 1.], [2., -3.]],[ -2, -1])
print(x0)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: [-1.4 -0.6]

We form the system of ODEs by differentiating the new equations with respect to $\lambda$. Why do we do that? The solution, (x,y) will be a function of $\lambda$. From calculus, you can show that:

$\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}\frac{\partial x}{\partial \lambda}+\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}\frac{\partial y}{\partial \lambda}=-\frac{\partial f}{\partial \lambda}$

$\frac{\partial g}{\partial x}\frac{\partial x}{\partial \lambda}+\frac{\partial g}{\partial y}\frac{\partial y}{\partial \lambda}=-\frac{\partial g}{\partial \lambda}$

Now, solve this for $\frac{\partial x}{\partial \lambda}$ and $\frac{\partial y}{\partial \lambda}$. You can use Cramer's rule to solve for these to yield:

\begin{eqnarray} \
\frac{\partial x}{\partial \lambda} &=& \frac{\partial f/\partial y \partial g/\partial \lambda - \partial f/\partial \lambda \partial g/\partial y}{\partial f/\partial x \partial g/\partial y - \partial f/\partial y \partial g/\partial x } \\\\
\frac{\partial y}{\partial \lambda} &=& \frac{\partial f/\partial \lambda \partial g/\partial x - \partial f/\partial x \partial g/\partial \lambda}{\partial f/\partial x \partial g/\partial y - \partial f/\partial y \partial g/\partial x } \end{eqnarray}

For this set of equations:

\begin{eqnarray} \
\partial f/\partial x &=& 1 - 2\lambda x + 8\lambda y \\\\
\partial f/\partial y &=& 1 + 8 \lambda x + 3 \lambda y^2 \\\\
\partial g/\partial x &=& 2 + 2 \lambda x + \lambda y - \lambda y e^x\\\\
\partial g/\partial y &=& -3 + \lambda x - \lambda e^x
\end{eqnarray}

Now, we simply set up those two differential equations on $\frac{\partial x}{\partial \lambda}$ and $\frac{\partial y}{\partial \lambda}$, with the initial conditions at $\lambda = 0$ which is the solution of the simpler linear equations, and integrate to $\lambda = 1$, which is the final solution of the original equations!

You can see the solution is somewhat approximate; the true solution is x = -1, y = 0. The approximation could be improved by lowering the tolerance on the ODE solver. The functions evaluate to a small number, close to zero. You have to apply some judgment to determine if that is sufficiently accurate. For instance if the units on that answer are kilometers, but you need an answer accurate to a millimeter, this may not be accurate enough.

This is a fair amount of work to get a solution! The idea is to solve a simple problem, and then gradually turn on the hard part by the lambda parameter. What happens if there are multiple solutions? The answer you finally get will depend on your $\lambda=0$  starting point, so it is possible to miss solutions this way. For problems with lots of variables, this would be a good approach if you can identify the easy problem.

Yesterday in Post 1324 we looked at a way to solve nonlinear equations that takes away some of the burden of initial guess generation. The idea was to reformulate the equations with a new variable $\lambda$, so that at $\lambda=0$ we have a simpler problem we know how to solve, and at $\lambda=1$ we have the original set of equations. Then, we derive a set of ODEs on how the solution changes with $\lambda$, and solve them.

Today we look at a simpler example and explain a little more about what is going on. Consider the equation: $f(x) = x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0$, which has two roots, $x=2$ and $x=3$. We will use the method of continuity to solve this equation to illustrate a few ideas. First, we introduce a new variable $\lambda$ as: $f(x; \lambda) = 0$. For example, we could write $f(x;\lambda) = \lambda x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0$. Now, when $\lambda=0$, we hve the simpler equation $- 5x + 6 = 0$, with the solution $x=6/5$. The question now is, how does $x$ change as $\lambda$ changes? We get that from the total derivative of how $f(x,\lambda)$ changes with $\lambda$. The total derivative is:

$$\frac{df}{d\lambda} = \frac{\partial f}{\partial \lambda} + \frac{\partial f}{\partial x}\frac{\partial x}{\partial \lambda}=0$$

We can calculate two of those quantities: $\frac{\partial f}{\partial \lambda}$ and $\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}$ analytically from our equation and solve for $\frac{\partial x}{\partial \lambda}$ as

$$ \frac{\partial x}{\partial \lambda} = -\frac{\partial f}{\partial \lambda}/\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}$$

That defines an ordinary differential equation that we can solve by integrating from $\lambda=0$ where we know the solution to $\lambda=1$ which is the solution to the real problem. For this problem: $\frac{\partial f}{\partial \lambda}=x^2$ and $\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}=-5 + 2\lambda x$.

We found one solution at x=2. What about the other solution? To get that we have to introduce $\lambda$ into the equations in another way. We could try: $f(x;\lambda) = x^2 + \lambda(-5x + 6)$, but this leads to an ODE that is singular at the initial starting point. Another approach is $f(x;\lambda) = x^2 + 6 + \lambda(-5x)$, but now the solution at $\lambda=0$ is imaginary, and we do not have a way to integrate that! What we can do instead is add and subtract a number like this: $f(x;\lambda) = x^2 - 4 + \lambda(-5x + 6 + 4)$. Now at $\lambda=0$, we have a simple equation with roots at $\pm 2$, and we already know that $x=2$ is a solution. So, we create our ODE on $dx/d\lambda$ with initial condition $x(0) = -2$.

#+BEGIN_SRC python

#+RESULTS:

Now we have the other solution. Note if you choose the other root, $x=2$, you find that 2 is a root, and learn nothing new. You could choose other values to add, e.g., if you chose to add and subtract 16, then you would find that one starting point leads to one root, and the other starting point leads to the other root. This method does not solve all problems associated with nonlinear root solving, namely, how many roots are there, and which one is "best" or physically reasonable? But it does give a way to solve an equation where you have no idea what an initial guess should be. You can see, however, that just like you can get different answers from different initial guesses, here you can get different answers by setting up the equations differently.

The goal here is to determine how many roots there are in a nonlinear function we are interested in solving. For this example, we use a cubic polynomial because we know there are three roots.

$$f(x) = x^3 + 6x^2 - 4x -24$$

*** Use roots for this polynomial

This ony works for a polynomial, it does not work for any other nonlinear function.

Now we consider several approaches to counting the number of roots in this interval. Visually it is pretty easy, you just look for where the function crosses zero. Computationally, it is tricker.

*** method 1

Count the number of times the sign changes in the interval. What we have to do is multiply neighboring elements together, and look for negative values. That indicates a sign change. For example the product of two positive or negative numbers is a positive number. You only get a negative number from the product of a positive and negative number, which means the sign changed.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

x = np.linspace(-8, 4)
y = x**3 + 6 * x**2 - 4*x - 24

print(np.sum(y[0:-2] * y[1:-1] < 0))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: 3

This method gives us the number of roots, but not where the roots are.

*** Method 2

Using events in an ODE solver python can identify events in the solution to an ODE, for example, when a function has a certain value, e.g. f(x) = 0. We can take advantage of this to find the roots and number of roots in this case. We take the derivative of our function, and integrate it from an initial starting point, and define an event function that counts zeros.

$$f'(x) = 3x^2 + 12x - 4$$

with f(-8) = -120

There is a heat transfer problem where one needs to find the n^th root of the following equation: $x J_1(x) - Bi J_0(x)=0$ where $J_0$ and $J_1$ are the Bessel functions of zero and first order, and $Bi$ is the Biot number. We examine an approach to finding these roots.

First,  we plot the function.
#+BEGIN_SRC python

Bi = 1

def f(x):
    return x * jn(1, x) - Bi * jn(0, x)

You can see there are many roots to this equation, and we want to be sure we get the n^{th} root. This function is pretty well behaved, so if you make a good guess about the solution you will get an answer, but if you make a bad guess, you may get the wrong root. We examine next a way to do it without guessing the solution. What we want is the solution to $f(x) = 0$, but we want all the solutions in a given interval. We derive a new equation, $f'(x) = 0$, with initial condition $f(0) = f0$, and integrate the ODE with an event function that identifies all zeros of $f$ for us. The derivative of our function is $df/dx = d/dx(x J_1(x)) - Bi J'_0(x)$. It is known (http://www.markrobrien.com/besselfunct.pdf) that $d/dx(x J_1(x)) = x J_0(x)$, and $J'_0(x) = -J_1(x)$. All we have to do now is set up the problem and run it.

Interesting, we have to specify the divisor in numpy.std by the ddof argument. The default for this in Matlab is 1, the default for this function is 0.

Here is the principle of computing a confidence interval.

1. Compute the average
2. Compute the standard deviation of your data
3. Define the confidence interval, e.g. 95% = 0.95
4. Compute the student-t multiplier. This is a function of the confidence
   interval you specify, and the number of data points you have minus 1. You
   subtract 1 because one degree of freedom is lost from calculating the
   average.

The confidence interval is defined as ybar ± T_multiplier*std/sqrt(n).

Adapted from http://stattrek.com/ap-statistics-4/unpaired-means.aspx

Class A had 30 students who received an average test score of 78, with standard deviation of 10. Class B had 25 students an average test score of 85, with a standard deviation of 15. We want to know if the difference in these averages is statistically relevant. Note that we only have estimates of the true average and standard deviation for each class, and there is uncertainty in those estimates. As a result, we are unsure if the averages are really different. It could have just been luck that a few students in class B did better.

*** The hypothesis

the true averages are the same. We need to perform a two-sample t-test of the hypothesis that $\mu_1 - \mu_2 = 0$ (this is often called the null hypothesis). we use a two-tailed test because we do not care if the difference is positive or negative, either way means the averages are not the same.

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session
import numpy as np

n1 = 30  # students in class A
x1 = 78.0  # average grade in class A
s1 = 10.0  # std dev of exam grade in class A

n2 = 25  # students in class B
x2 = 85.0  # average grade in class B
s2 = 15.0  # std dev of exam grade in class B

# the standard error of the difference between the two averages.
SE = np.sqrt(s1**2 / n1 + s2**2 / n2)

# compute DOF
DF = (n1 - 1) + (n2 - 1)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:

See the discussion at http://stattrek.com/Help/Glossary.aspx?Target=Two-sample%20t-test for a more complex definition of degrees of freedom. Here we simply subtract one from each sample size to account for the estimation of the average of each sample.


*** Compute the t-score for our data

The difference between two averages determined from small sample numbers follows the t-distribution. the t-score is the difference between the difference of the means and the hypothesized difference of the means, normalized by the standard error. we compute the absolute value of the t-score to make sure it is positive for convenience later.
#+BEGIN_SRC python :session
tscore = np.abs(((x1 - x2) - 0) / SE)
print(tscore)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: 1.99323179108

*** Interpretation

A way to approach determining if the difference is significant or not is to ask, does our computed average fall within a confidence range of the hypothesized value (zero)? If it does, then we can attribute the difference to statistical variations at that confidence level. If it does not, we can say that statistical variations do not account for the difference at that confidence level, and hence the averages must be different.

Let us compute the t-value that corresponds to a 95% confidence level for a mean of zero with the degrees of freedom computed earlier. This means that 95% of the t-scores we expect to get will fall within ± t95.

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session
from scipy.stats.distributions import  t

ci = 0.95;
alpha = 1 - ci;
t95 = t.ppf(1.0 - alpha/2.0, DF)

print(t95)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: 2.00574599354

since tscore < t95, we conclude that at the 95% confidence level we cannot say these averages are statistically different because our computed t-score falls in the expected range of deviations. Note that our t-score is very close to the 95% limit. Let us consider a smaller confidence interval.

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session
ci = 0.94
alpha = 1 - ci;
t95 = t.ppf(1.0 - alpha/2.0, DF)

print(t95)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: 1.92191364181

at the 94% confidence level, however, tscore > t94, which means we can say with 94% confidence that the two averages are different; class B performed better than class A did. Alternatively, there is only about a 6% chance we are wrong about that statement.
another way to get there

An alternative way to get the confidence that the averages are different is to directly compute it from the cumulative t-distribution function. We compute the difference between all the t-values less than tscore and the t-values less than -tscore, which is the fraction of measurements that are between them. You can see here that we are practically 95% sure that the averages are different.

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session
f = t.cdf(tscore, DF) - t.cdf(-tscore, DF)

In this example, we show some ways to choose which of several models fit data the best. We have data for the total pressure and temperature of a fixed amount of a gas in a tank that was measured over the course of several days. We want to select a model that relates the pressure to the gas temperature.

The data is stored in a text file download PT.txt , with the following structure:

It appears the data is roughly linear, and we know from the ideal gas law that PV = nRT, or P = nR/V*T, which says P should be linearly correlated with V. Note that the temperature data is in degC, not in K, so it is not expected that P=0 at T = 0. We will use linear algebra to compute the line coefficients.

The confidence interval on the intercept is large, but it does not contain zero at the 95% confidence level.

The R^2 value accounts roughly for the fraction of variation in the data that can be described by the model. Hence, a value close to one means nearly all the variations are described by the model, except for random variations.

The fit looks good, and R^2 is near one, but is it a good model? There are a few ways to examine this. We want to make sure that there are no systematic trends in the errors between the fit and the data, and we want to make sure there are not hidden correlations with other variables. The residuals are the error between the fit and the data. The residuals should not show any patterns when plotted against any variables, and they do not in this case.

There may be some correlations in the residuals with the run order. That could indicate an experimental source of error.

We assume all the errors are uncorrelated with each other. We can use a lag plot to assess this, where we plot residual[i] vs residual[i-1], i.e. we look for correlations between adjacent residuals. This plot should look random, with no correlations if the model is good.

You can see that the confidence interval on the constant and T^2 term includes zero. That is a good indication this additional parameter is not significant. You can see also that the R^2 value is not better than the one from a linear fit,  so adding a parameter does not increase the goodness of fit. This is an example of overfitting the data. Since the constant in this model is apparently not significant, let us consider the simplest model with a fixed intercept of zero.

You can see a slight trend of decreasing value of the residuals as the Temperature increases. This may indicate a deficiency in the model with no intercept. For the ideal gas law in degC: $PV = nR(T+273)$ or $P = nR/V*T + 273*nR/V$, so the intercept is expected to be non-zero in this case. Specifically, we expect the intercept to be 273*R*n/V. Since the molar density of a gas is pretty small, the intercept may be close to, but not equal to zero. That is why the fit still looks ok, but is not as good as letting the intercept be a fitting parameter. That is an example of the deficiency in our model.

In the end, it is hard to justify a model more complex than a line in this case.

Propagation of errors is essential to understanding how the uncertainty in a parameter affects computations that use that parameter. The uncertainty propagates by a set of rules into your solution. These rules are not easy to remember, or apply to complicated situations, and are only approximate for equations that are nonlinear in the parameters.

We will use a Monte Carlo simulation to illustrate error propagation. The idea is to generate a distribution of possible parameter values, and to evaluate your equation for each parameter value. Then, we perform statistical analysis on the results to determine the standard error of the results.

We will assume all parameters are defined by a normal distribution with known mean and standard deviation.

You can numerically perform error propagation analysis if you know the underlying distribution of errors on the parameters in your equations. One benefit of the numerical propagation is you do not have to remember the error propagation rules, and you directly look at the distribution in nonlinear cases. Some limitations of this approach include

    1. You have to know the distribution of the errors in the parameters
    2. You have to assume the errors in parameters are uncorrelated.

In the previous section we examined an analytical approach to error propagation, and a simulation based approach. There is another approach to error propagation, using the uncertainties module (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/uncertainties/). You have to install this package, e.g. =pip install uncertainties=. After that, the module provides new classes of numbers and functions that incorporate uncertainty and propagate the uncertainty through the functions. In the examples that follow, we repeat the calculations from the previous section using the uncertainties module.

_A real example?_
This is what I would setup for a real working example. We try to compute the exit concentration from a CSTR. The idea is to wrap the "external" fsolve function using the =uncertainties.wrap= function, which handles the units. Unfortunately, it does not work, and it is not clear why. But see the following discussion for a fix.

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session
from scipy.optimize import fsolve

Fa0 = u.ufloat((5.0, 0.05))
v0 = u.ufloat((10., 0.1))

V = u.ufloat((66000.0, 100))  # reactor volume L^3
k = u.ufloat((3.0, 0.2))      # rate constant L/mol/h

def func(Ca):
    "Mole balance for a CSTR. Solve this equation for func(Ca)=0"
    Fa = v0 * Ca     # exit molar flow of A
    ra = -k * Ca**2  # rate of reaction of A L/mol/h
    return Fa0 - Fa + V * ra

# CA guess that that 90 % is reacted away
CA_guess = 0.1 * Fa0 / v0

wrapped_fsolve = u.wrap(fsolve)
CA_sol = wrapped_fsolve(func, CA_guess)

print('The exit concentration is {0} mol/L'.format(CA_sol))

I got a note from the author of the uncertainties package explaining the cryptic error above, and a solution for it. The error arises because fsolve does not know how to deal with uncertainties. The idea is to create a function that returns a float, when everything is given as a float. Then, we wrap the fsolve call, and finally wrap the wrapped fsolve call!

- Step 1. Write the function to solve with arguments for all unitted quantities. This function may be called with uncertainties, or with floats.

- Step 2. Wrap the call to fsolve in a function that takes all the parameters as arguments, and that returns the solution.

- Step 3. Use uncertainties.wrap to wrap the function in Step 2 to get the answer with uncertainties.

Here is the code that does work:
#+BEGIN_SRC python :session
import uncertainties as u
from scipy.optimize import fsolve

Fa0 = u.ufloat((5.0, 0.05))
v0 = u.ufloat((10., 0.1))

V = u.ufloat((66000.0, 100.0))  # reactor volume L^3
k = u.ufloat((3.0, 0.2))      # rate constant L/mol/h

# Step 1
def func(Ca, v0, k, Fa0, V):
    "Mole balance for a CSTR. Solve this equation for func(Ca)=0"
    Fa = v0 * Ca     # exit molar flow of A
    ra = -k * Ca**2  # rate of reaction of A L/mol/h
    return Fa0 - Fa + V * ra

# Step 2
def Ca_solve(v0, k, Fa0, V):
    'wrap fsolve to pass parameters as float or units'
    # this line is a little fragile. You must put [0] at the end or
    # you get the NotImplemented result
    guess = 0.1 * Fa0 / v0
    sol = fsolve(func, guess, args=(v0, k, Fa0, V))[0]
    return sol

# Step 3
print(u.wrap(Ca_solve)(v0, k, Fa0, V))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: 0.00500+/-0.00017

It would take some practice to get used to this, but the payoff is that you have an "automatic" error propagation method.

Being ever the skeptic, let us compare the result above to the Monte Carlo approach to error estimation below.

Random numbers are used in a variety of simulation methods, most notably Monte Carlo simulations. In another later example, we will see how we can use random numbers for error propagation analysis. First, we discuss two types of pseudorandom numbers we can use in python: uniformly distributed and normally distributed numbers.

Say you are the gambling type, and bet your friend $5 the next random number will be greater than 0.49. Let us ask Python to roll the random number generator for us.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
import numpy as np

n = np.random.uniform()

    print('You win!')
else:
    print('you lose.')
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:

: you lose.

The odds of you winning the last bet are slightly stacked in your favor. There is only a 49% chance your friend wins, but a 51% chance that you win. Lets play the game a lot of times times and see how many times you win, and your friend wins. First, lets generate a bunch of numbers and look at the distribution with a histogram.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
import numpy as np

N = 10000
games = np.random.uniform(size=N)

wins = np.sum(games > 0.49)
losses = N - wins

print('You won {0} times ({1:%})'.format(wins, float(wins) / N))

It is possible to get random integers. Here are a few examples of getting a random integer between 1 and 100. You might do this to get random indices of a list, for example.

The normal distribution is defined by $f(x)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi \sigma^2}} \exp (-\frac{(x-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2})$ where $\mu$ is the mean value, and $\sigma$ is the standard deviation. In the standard distribution, $\mu=0$ and $\sigma=1$.

What fraction of points lie between plus and minus one standard deviation of the mean?

samples >= mu-sigma will return a vector of ones where the inequality is true, and zeros where it is not. (samples >= mu-sigma) & (samples <= mu+sigma) will return a vector of ones where there is a one in both vectors, and a zero where there is not. In other words, a vector where both inequalities are true. Finally, we can sum the vector to get the number of elements where the two inequalities are true, and finally normalize by the total number of samples to get the fraction of samples that are greater than -sigma and less than sigma.

#+BEGIN_SRC python

b = np.sum((samples >= (mu - 2*sigma)) & (samples <= (mu + 2*sigma))) / float(N)
print('{0:%} of samples are within +- standard deviations of the mean'.format(a))
print('{0:%} of samples are within +- 2standard deviations of the mean'.format(b))
#+END_SRC

*** Summary
We only considered the numpy.random functions here, and not all of them. There are many distributions of random numbers to choose from. There are also random numbers in the python random module. Remember these are only [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudorandom_number_generator][pseudorandom]] numbers, but they are still useful for many applications.

The idea here is to formulate a set of linear equations that is easy to solve. We  can express the equations in terms of our unknown fitting parameters $p_i$ as:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
x1^0*p0 + x1*p1 = y1
x2^0*p0 + x2*p1 = y2
x3^0*p0 + x3*p1 = y3
etc...
#+END_EXAMPLE

Which we write in matrix form as $A p = y$ where $A$ is a matrix of column vectors, e.g. [1, x_i]. $A$ is not a square matrix, so we cannot solve it as written. Instead, we form $A^T A p = A^T y$ and solve that set of equations.

This method can be readily extended to fitting any polynomial model, or other linear model that is fit in a least squares sense. This method does not provide confidence intervals.

Fit a fourth order polynomial to this data and determine the confidence interval for each parameter. Data from example 5-1 in Fogler, Elements of Chemical Reaction Engineering.

We want the equation $Ca(t) = b0 + b1*t + b2*t^2 + b3*t^3 + b4*t^4$ fit to the data in the least squares sense. We can write this in a linear algebra form as: T*p = Ca where T is a matrix of columns [1 t t^2 t^3 t^4], and p is a column vector of the fitting parameters. We want to solve for the p vector and estimate the confidence intervals.

A fourth order polynomial fits the data well, with a good R^2 value. All of the parameters appear to be significant, i.e. zero is not included in any of the parameter confidence intervals. This does not mean this is the best model for the data, just that the model fits well.

We can do nonlinear fitting by directly minimizing the summed squared error between a model and data. This method lacks some of the features of other methods, notably the simple ability to get the confidence interval. However, this method is flexible and may offer more insight into how the solution depends on the parameters.

We often need to estimate parameters from nonlinear regression of data. We should also consider how good the parameters are, and one way to do that is to consider the confidence interval. A confidence interval tells us a range that we are confident the true parameter lies in.

In this example we use a nonlinear curve-fitting function: scipy.optimize.curve_fit to give us the parameters in a function that we define which best fit the data. The scipy.optimize.curve_fit function also gives us the [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covariance_matrix][covariance]] matrix which we can use to estimate the standard error of each parameter. Finally,  we modify the standard error by a student-t value which accounts for the additional uncertainty in our estimates due to the small number of data points we are fitting to.

We will fit the function $y = a x / (b + x)$ to some data, and compute the 95% confidence intervals on the parameters.

You can see by inspection that the fit looks pretty reasonable. The parameter confidence intervals are not too big, so we can be pretty confident of their values.

This is actually could be a linear regression problem, but it is convenient to illustrate the  use the nonlinear fitting routine because it makes it easy to get

Fit the model f(x1,x2; a,b) = a*x1 + x2^b to the data given below. This model has two independent variables, and two parameters.

We want to do a nonlinear fit to find a and b that minimize the summed squared errors between the model predictions and the data. With only two variables, we can graph how the summed squared error varies with the parameters, which may help us get initial guesses. Let us assume the parameters lie in a range, here we choose 0 to 5. In other problems you would adjust this as needed.

*** improved interpolation?

Wow. That is a weird looking fit. Very different from what Matlab [[http://matlab.cheme.cmu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/interp_methods_02.png][produces]]. This is a good teaching moment not to rely blindly on interpolation! We will rely on the linear interpolation from here out which behaves predictably.

*** The inverse question

It is easy to interpolate a new value of f given a value of t. What if we want to know the time that f=0.2? We can approach this a few ways.

**** method 1

We setup a function that we can use fsolve on. The function will be equal to zero at the time. The second function will look like 0 = 0.2 - f(t). The answer for 0.2=exp(-t) is t = 1.6094. Since we use interpolation here, we will get an approximate answer.

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session
from scipy.optimize import fsolve

def func(t):
    return 0.2 - g(t)

initial_guess = 2
ans, = fsolve(func, initial_guess)
print(ans)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: 2.0556428796

**** method 2: switch the interpolation order

We can switch the order of the interpolation to solve this problem. An issue we have to address in this method is that the "x" values must be monotonically /increasing/. It is somewhat subtle to reverse a list in python. I will use the cryptic syntax of [::-1] instead of the list.reverse() function or reversed() function. list.reverse() actually reverses the list "in place", which changes the contents of the variable. That is not what I want. reversed() returns an iterator which is also not what I want. [::-1] is a fancy indexing trick that returns a reversed list.

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session
g3 = interp1d(f[::-1], t[::-1])

print(g3(0.2))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: 2.055642879597611

*** A harder problem

Suppose we want to know at what time is 1/f = 100? Now we have to decide what do we interpolate: f(t) or 1/f(t). Let us look at both ways and decide what is best. The answer to $1/exp(-t) = 100$ is 4.6052

**** interpolate on f(t) then invert the interpolated number

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session
def func(t):
    'objective function. we do some error bounds because we cannot interpolate out of the range.'
    if t < 0.5: t=0.5
    if t > 6: t = 6
    return 100 - 1.0 / g(t)

initial_guess = 4.5
a1, = fsolve(func, initial_guess)
print(a1)
print('The %error is {0:%}'.format((a1 - 4.6052)/4.6052))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:

def ifunc(t):
    if t < 0.5:
	t=0.5
    elif t > 6:
	t = 6
    return 100 - ig(t)

initial_guess = 4.5
a2, = fsolve(ifunc, initial_guess)

#+END_SRC

In this case you get different errors, one overestimates and one underestimates the answer, and by a lot: ± 20%. Let us look at what is happening.

You can see that the 1/interpolated f(x) underestimates the value, while interpolated (1/f(x)) overestimates the value. This is an example of where you clearly need more data in that range to make good estimates. Neither interpolation method is doing a great job. The trouble in reality is that you often do not know the real function to do this analysis. Here you can say the time is probably between 3.6 and 5.5 where 1/f(t) = 100, but you can not read much more than that into it. If you need a more precise answer, you need better data, or you need to use an approach other than interpolation. For example, you could fit an exponential function to the data and use that to estimate values at other times.

So which is the best to interpolate? I think you should interpolate the quantity that is linear in the problem you want to solve, so in this case I think interpolating 1/f(x) is better. When you use an interpolated function in a nonlinear function, strange, unintuitive things can happen. That is why the blue curve looks odd. Between data points are linear segments in the original interpolation, but when you invert them, you cause the curvature to form.

When we have data at two points but we need data in between them we use interpolation. Suppose we have the points (4,3) and (6,2) and we want to know the value of y at x=4.65, assuming y varies linearly between these points. we use the interp1d command to achieve this. The syntax in python is slightly different than in matlab.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
from scipy.interpolate import interp1d

x = [4, 6]
y = [3, 2]

ifunc = interp1d(x, y)

print(ifunc(4.65))


ifunc = interp1d(x, y, bounds_error=False) # do not raise error on out of bounds
print(ifunc([4.65, 5.01, 4.2, 9]))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: 2.675
: [ 2.675  2.495  2.9      nan]

The default interpolation method is simple linear interpolation between points. Other methods exist too, such as fitting a cubic spline to the data and using the spline representation to interpolate from.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
from scipy.interpolate import interp1d

x = [1, 2, 3, 4];
y = [1, 4, 9, 16]; # y = x^2

xi = [ 1.5, 2.5, 3.5]; # we want to interpolate on these values
y1 = interp1d(x,y)

print(y1(xi))

y2 = interp1d(x,y,'cubic')
print(y2(xi))

import numpy as np
print(np.array(xi)**2)

: [  2.25   6.25  12.25]
: [  2.25   6.25  12.25]

In this case the cubic spline interpolation is  more accurate than the linear interpolation. That is because the underlying data was polynomial in nature, and a spline is like a polynomial. That may not always be the case, and you need some engineering judgement to know which method is best.

A photovoltaic device is characterized by a current-voltage relationship. Let us say, for argument's sake, that the relationship is known and defined by

\(i = 0.5 - 0.5 * V^2\)

The voltage is highest when the current is equal to zero, but of course then you get no power. The current is highest when the voltage is zero, i.e. short-circuited, but there is again no power. We seek the highest power condition, which is to find the maximum of \(i V\). This is a constrained optimization. We solve it by creating an objective function that returns the negative of (\i V\), and then find the minimum.

First, let us examine the i-V relationship.

def func(X):
    x = X[0]
    y = X[1]
    L = X[2] # this is the multiplier. lambda is a reserved keyword in python
    return x + y + L * (x**2 + y**2 - 1)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:

*** Finding the partial derivatives

The minima/maxima of the augmented function are located where all of the partial derivatives of the augmented function are equal to zero, i.e. $\partial \Lambda/\partial x = 0$, $\partial \Lambda/\partial y = 0$, and $\partial \Lambda/\partial \lambda = 0$. the process for solving this is usually to analytically evaluate the partial derivatives, and then solve the unconstrained resulting equations, which may be nonlinear.

Rather than perform the analytical differentiation, here we develop a way to numerically approximate the partial derivatives.

def dfunc(X):
    dLambda = np.zeros(len(X))
    h = 1e-3 # this is the step size used in the finite difference.
    for i in range(len(X)):
	dX = np.zeros(len(X))
	dX[i] = h
	dLambda[i] = (func(X+dX)-func(X-dX))/(2*h);
    return dLambda
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:

*** Now we solve for the zeros in the partial derivatives

The function we defined above (dfunc) will equal zero at a maximum or minimum. It turns out there are two solutions to this problem, but only one of them is the maximum value. Which solution you get depends on the initial guess provided to the solver. Here we have to use some judgement to identify the maximum.

*** Summary
Three dimensional plots in matplotlib are a little more difficult than in Matlab (where the code is almost the same as 2D plots, just different commands, e.g. plot vs plot3). In Matplotlib you have to import additional modules in the right order, and use the object oriented approach to plotting as shown here.

adapted from http://www.matrixlab-examples.com/linear-programming.html which solves this problem with fminsearch.

Let us suppose that a merry farmer has 75 roods (4 roods = 1 acre) on which to plant two crops: wheat and corn. To produce these crops, it costs the farmer (for seed, water, fertilizer, etc. ) $120 per rood for the wheat, and $210 per rood for the corn. The farmer has $15,000 available for expenses, but after the harvest the farmer must store the crops while awaiting favorable or good market conditions. The farmer has storage space for 4,000 bushels. Each rood yields an average of 110 bushels of wheat or 30 bushels of corn. If the net profit per bushel of wheat (after all the expenses) is $1.30 and for corn is $2.00, how should the merry farmer plant the 75 roods to maximize profit?

Let $x$ be the number of roods of wheat planted, and $y$ be the number of roods of corn planted. The profit function is: \( P = (110)($1.3)x + (30)($2)y = 143x + 60y \)

There are some constraint inequalities, specified by the limits on expenses, storage and roodage. They are:

\(\$120x + \$210y <= \$15000\) (The total amount spent cannot exceed the amount the farm has)

\(110x + 30y <= 4000\) (The amount generated should not exceed storage space.)

\(x + y <= 75\) (We cannot plant more space than we have.)

\(0 <= x and 0 <= y \) (all amounts of planted land must be positive.)

To solve this problem, we cast it as a linear programming problem, which minimizes a function f(X) subject to some constraints. We create a proxy function for the negative of profit, which we seek to minimize.

f = -(143*x + 60*y)

A problem that can be cast as a constrained minimization problem is to find the minimum distance from a point to a curve. Suppose we have $f(x) = x^2$, and the point (0.5, 2). what is the minimum distance from that point to $f(x)$?

[[./images/min-dist-p-func.png]]

In the code above, we demonstrate that the point we find on the curve that minimizes the distance satisfies the property that a vector from that point to our other point is normal to the tangent of the curve at that point. This is shown by the fact that the dot product of the two vectors is very close to zero. It is not zero because of the accuracy criteria that is used to stop the minimization is not high enough.
* Differential equations
The key to successfully solving many differential equations is correctly classifying the equations, putting them into a standard form and then picking the appropriate solver. You must be able to determine if an equation is:

- An ordinary differential equation $Y' = f(x, Y)$ with
  + initial values (good support in python/numpy/scipy)
  + boundary values (not difficult to write code for simple cases)
- Delay differential equation
- Differential algebraic equations
- A partial differential equation

The following sections will illustrate the methods for solving these kinds of equations.

Integrate this ordinary differential equation (ode):

$$\frac{dy}{dt} = y(t)$$

over the time span of 0 to 2. The initial condition is y(0) = 1.

to solve this equation, you need to create a function of the form: dydt = f(y, t) and then use one of the odesolvers, e.g. odeint.

Now, suppose you want to know at what time is the solution equal to 3? There are several approaches to this, including setting up a solver, or using an event like approach to stop integration at y=3. A simple approach is to use reverse interpolation. We simply reverse the x and y vectors so that y is the independent variable, and we interpolate the corresponding x-value.

A mixing tank initially contains 300 g of salt mixed into 1000 L of water. At t=0 min, a solution of 4 g/L salt enters the tank at 6 L/min. At t=10 min, the solution is changed to 2 g/L salt, still entering at 6 L/min. The tank is well stirred, and the tank solution leaves at a rate of 6 L/min. Plot the concentration of salt (g/L) in the tank as a function of time.

A mass balance on the salt in the tank leads to this differential equation: $\frac{dM_S}{dt} = \nu C_{S,in}(t) - \nu M_S/V$ with the initial condition that $M_S(t=0)=300$. The wrinkle is that the inlet conditions are not constant.

$$C_{S,in}(t) = \begin{array}{ll} 0 & t \le 0, \\ 4 & 0 < t \le 10, \\ 2 & t > 10. \end{array}$$

*** Simulating the events feature of Matlab's ode solvers
The ode solvers in Matlab allow you create functions that define events that can stop the integration, detect roots, etc... We will explore how to get a similar effect in python. Here is an example that somewhat does this, but it is only an approximation. We will manually integrate the ODE, adjusting the time step in each iteration to zero in on the solution. When the desired accuracy is reached, we stop the integration.

It does not appear that events are supported in scipy. A solution is at http://mail.scipy.org/pipermail/scipy-dev/2005-July/003078.html, but it does not appear integrated into scipy yet (8 years later ;).

This particular solution works for this example, probably because it is well behaved. It is "downhill" to the desired solution. It is not obvious this would work for every example, and it is certainly possible the algorithm could go "backward" in time. A better approach might be to integrate forward until you detect a sign change in your event function, and then refine it in a separate loop.

I like the events integration in Matlab better, but this is actually pretty functional. It should not be too hard to use this for root counting, e.g. by counting sign changes. It would be considerably harder to get the actual roots. It might also be hard to get the positions of events that include the sign or value of the derivatives at the event points.

ODE solving in Matlab is considerably more advanced in functionality than in scipy. There do seem to be some extra packages, e.g. pydstools, scikits.odes that add extra ode functionality.

The analytical solution to an ODE is a function, which can be solved to get a particular value, e.g. if the solution to an ODE is y(x) = exp(x), you can solve the solution to find the value of x that makes $y(x)=2$. In a numerical solution to an ODE we get a vector of independent variable values, and the corresponding function values at those values. To solve for a particular function value we need a different approach. This post will show one way to do that in python.

Given that the concentration of a species A in a constant volume, batch reactor obeys this differential equation $\frac{dC_A}{dt}=- k C_A^2$ with the initial condition $C_A(t=0) = 2.3$ mol/L and $k = 0.23$ L/mol/s, compute the time it takes for $C_A$ to be reduced to 1 mol/L.

We will get a solution, then create an interpolating function and use fsolve to get the answer. index:interpolation!ODE

That is it. Interpolation can provide a simple way to evaluate the numerical solution of an ODE at other values.

For completeness we examine a final way to construct the function. We can actually integrate the ODE in the function to evaluate the solution at the point of interest. If it is not computationally expensive to evaluate the ODE solution this works fine. Note, however, that the ODE will get integrated from 0 to the value t for each iteration of fsolve.

In Post 968 we learned how to get the numerical solution to an ODE, and then to use the deval function to solve the solution for a particular value. The deval function uses interpolation to evaluate the solution at other valuse. An alternative approach would be to stop the ODE integration when the solution has the value you want. That can be done in Matlab by using an "event" function. You setup an event function and tell the ode solver to use it by setting an option.

Today we look at another way to use events in an ode solver. We use an events function to find minima and maxima, by evaluating the ODE in the event function to find conditions where the first derivative is zero, and approached from the right direction. A maximum is when the fisrt derivative is zero and increasing, and a minimum is when the first derivative is zero and decreasing.

We use a simple ODE, $y' = sin(x)*e^{-0.05x}$, which has minima and maxima.

The problem here was the derivative value varied by four orders of magnitude over the integration range, so the default tolerances were insufficient to accurately estimate the numerical derivatives over that range. Tightening the tolerances helped resolve that problem. Another approach might be to split the integration up into different regions. For instance, if instead of starting at Vr = 0.34, which is very close to a sigularity in the van der waal equation at Vr = 1/3, if you start at Vr = 0.5, the solution integrates just fine with the standard tolerances.

Sometimes we have an ODE that depends on a parameter, and we want to solve the ODE for several parameter values. It is inconvenient to write an ode function for each parameter case. Here we examine a convenient way to solve this problem; we pass the parameter to the ODE at runtime. We consider the following ODE:

$$\frac{dCa}{dt} = -k Ca(t)$$

where $k$ is a parameter, and we want to solve the equation for a couple of values of $k$ to test the sensitivity of the solution on the parameter. Our question is, given $Ca(t=0)=2$, how long does it take to get $Ca = 1$, and how sensitive is the answer to small variations in $k$?

You can see there are some variations in the concentration at t = 0.5. You could over or underestimate the concentration if you have the wrong estimate of $k$! You have to use some judgement here to decide how long to run the reaction to ensure a target goal is met.

We want a convenient way to solve $dCa/dt = -k Ca$ for multiple values of $k$. Here we use a trick to pass a parameter to an ODE through the initial conditions. We expand the ode function definition to include this parameter, and set its derivative to zero, effectively making it a constant.

Here we define the ODE function in a loop. Since the nested function is in the namespace of the main function, it can "see" the values of the variables in the main function. We will use this method to look at the solution to the van der Pol equation for several different values of mu.

You can see the solution changes dramatically for different values of mu. The point here is not to understand why, but to show an easy way to study a parameterize ode with a nested function.

$\mu$ is a constant. If we let $y=x - x^3/3$ http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_der_Pol_oscillator, then we arrive at this set of equations:

Reference Ch 5.5 Kreysig, Advanced Engineering Mathematics, 9th ed.

Bessel's equation $x^2 y'' + x y' + (x^2 - \nu^2)y=0$ comes up often in engineering problems such as heat transfer. The solutions to this equation are the Bessel functions. To solve this equation numerically, we must convert it to a system of first order ODEs. This can be done by letting $z = y'$ and $z' = y''$ and performing the change of variables:

$$ y' = z$$

$$ z' = \frac{1}{x^2}(-x z - (x^2 - \nu^2) y$$

if we take the case where $\nu = 0$, the solution is known to be the Bessel function $J_0(x)$, which is represented in Matlab as besselj(0,x). The initial conditions for this problem are: $y(0) = 1$ and $y'(0)=0$.

There is a problem with our system of ODEs at x=0. Because of the $1/x^2$ term, the ODEs are not defined at x=0. If we start very close to zero instead, we avoid the problem.

An undamped pendulum with no driving force is described by

$$ y'' + sin(y) = 0$$

We reduce this to standard matlab form of a system of first order ODEs by letting $y_1 = y$ and $y_2=y_1'$. This leads to:

$y_1' = y_2$

$y_2' = -sin(y_1)$

The phase portrait is a plot of a vector field which qualitatively shows how the solutions to these equations will go from a given starting point. here is our definition of the differential equations:

To generate the phase portrait, we need to compute the derivatives $y_1'$ and $y_2'$ at $t=0$ on a grid over the range of values for $y_1$ and $y_2$ we are interested in. We will plot the derivatives as a vector at each (y1, y2) which will show us the initial direction from each point. We will examine the solutions over the range -2 < y1 < 8, and -2 < y2 < 2 for y2, and create a grid of 20 x 20 points.

What do these figures mean? For starting points near the origin, and small velocities, the pendulum goes into a stable limit cycle. For others, the trajectory appears to fly off into y1 space. Recall that y1 is an angle that has values from $-\pi$ to $\pi$. The y1 data in this case is not wrapped around to be in this range.

Today we consider how to solve a system of first order, constant coefficient ordinary differential equations using linear algebra. These equations could be solved numerically, but in this case there are analytical solutions that can be derived. The equations we will solve are:

$y'_1 = -0.02 y_1 + 0.02 y_2$

$y'_2 = 0.02 y_1 - 0.02 y_2$

We can express this set of equations in matrix form as: $\left[\begin{array}{c}y'_1\\y'_2\end{array}\right] = \left[\begin{array}{cc} -0.02 & 0.02 \\ 0.02 & -0.02\end{array}\right] \left[\begin{array}{c}y_1\\y_2\end{array}\right]$

The general solution to this set of equations is

$\left[\begin{array}{c}y_1\\y_2\end{array}\right] = \left[\begin{array}{cc}v_1 & v_2\end{array}\right] \left[\begin{array}{cc} c_1 & 0 \\ 0 & c_2\end{array}\right] \exp\left(\left[\begin{array}{cc} \lambda_1 & 0 \\ 0 & \lambda_2\end{array}\right] \left[\begin{array}{c}t\\t\end{array}\right]\right)$

where $\left[\begin{array}{cc} \lambda_1 & 0 \\ 0 & \lambda_2\end{array}\right]$ is a diagonal matrix of the eigenvalues of the constant coefficient matrix, $\left[\begin{array}{cc}v_1 & v_2\end{array}\right]$ is a matrix of eigenvectors where the $i^{th}$ column corresponds to the eigenvector of the $i^{th}$ eigenvalue, and $\left[\begin{array}{cc} c_1 & 0 \\ 0 & c_2\end{array}\right]$ is a matrix determined by the initial conditions.

In this example, we evaluate the solution using linear algebra. The initial conditions we will consider are $y_1(0)=0$ and $y_2(0)=150$.

**  Delay Differential Equations
In Matlab you can solve Delay Differential equations (DDE) ([[http://matlab.cheme.cmu.edu/2011/09/28/delay-differential-equations/][Matlab post]]). I do not know of a solver in scipy at this time that can do this.
**  Differential algebraic systems of equations
There is not a builtin solver for DAE systems in scipy. It looks like [[http://pysundials.sourceforge.net/][pysundials]] may do it, but it must be compiled and installed.

**  Boundary value equations
I am unaware of dedicated BVP solvers in scipy. In the following examples we implement some approaches to solving certain types of linear BVPs.

[[http://matlab.cheme.cmu.edu/2011/09/08/plane-poiseuille-flow-bvp-solve-by-shooting-method/][Matlab post]]

One approach to solving BVPs is to use the shooting method. The reason we cannot use an initial value solver for a BVP is that there is not enough information at the initial value to start. In the shooting method, we take the function value at the initial point, and guess what the function derivatives are so that we can do an integration. If our guess was good, then the solution will go through the known second boundary point. If not, we guess again, until we get the answer we need. In this example we repeat the pressure driven flow example, but illustrate the shooting method.

In the pressure driven flow of a fluid with viscosity $\mu$ between two stationary plates separated by distance $d$ and driven by a pressure drop $\Delta P/\Delta x$, the governing equations on the velocity $u$ of the fluid are (assuming flow in the x-direction with the velocity varying only in the y-direction):

$$\frac{\Delta P}{\Delta x} = \mu \frac{d^2u}{dy^2}$$

with boundary conditions $u(y=0) = 0$ and $u(y=d) = 0$, i.e. the no-slip condition at the edges of the plate.

we convert this second order BVP to a system of ODEs by letting $u_1 = u$, $u_2 = u_1'$ and then $u_2' = u_1''$. This leads to:

$\frac{d u_1}{dy} = u_2$

$\frac{d u_2}{dy} = \frac{1}{\mu}\frac{\Delta P}{\Delta x}$

with boundary conditions $u_1(y=0) = 0$ and $u_1(y=d) = 0$.

for this problem we let the plate separation be d=0.1, the viscosity $\mu = 1$, and $\frac{\Delta P}{\Delta x} = -100$.

**** First guess

We need u_1(0) and u_2(0), but we only have u_1(0). We need to guess a value for u_2(0) and see if the solution goes through the u_2(d)=0 boundary value.

#+BEGIN_SRC python

    Pdrop = -100
    du1dy = u2
    du2dy = 1.0 / mu * Pdrop
    return [du1dy, du2dy]

u1_0 = 0 # known
u2_0 = 1 # guessed

dspan = np.linspace(0, d)

U = odeint(odefun, [u1_0, u2_0], dspan)

Here we have undershot the boundary condition. Let us try a larger guess.

**** Second guess

import numpy as np
from scipy.integrate import odeint

d = 0.1 # plate thickness

def odefun(U, y):

    du1dy = u2
    du2dy = 1.0 / mu * Pdrop
    return [du1dy, du2dy]

u1_0 = 0 # known
u2_0 = 10 # guessed

Adapted from http://www.physics.arizona.edu/~restrepo/475B/Notes/sourcehtml/node24.html

We want to solve a linear boundary value problem of the form: y'' = p(x)y' + q(x)y + r(x) with boundary conditions y(x1) = alpha and y(x2) = beta.

For this example, we solve the plane poiseuille flow problem using a finite difference approach. An advantage of the approach we use here is we do not have to rewrite the second order ODE as a set of coupled first order ODEs, nor do we have to provide guesses for the solution. We do, however, have to discretize the derivatives and formulate a linear algebra problem.

we want to solve u'' = 1/mu*DPDX with u(0)=0 and u(0.1)=0. for this problem we let the plate separation be d=0.1, the viscosity $\mu = 1$, and $\frac{\Delta P}{\Delta x} = -100$.

The idea behind the finite difference method is to approximate the derivatives by finite differences on a grid. See here for details. By discretizing the ODE, we arrive at a set of linear algebra equations of the form $A y = b$, where $A$ and $b$ are defined as follows.

\[A = \left [ \begin{array}{ccccc} %

For steady state heat conduction the temperature distribution in one-dimension is governed by the Laplace equation:

$$ \nabla^2 T = 0$$

with boundary conditions that at $T(x=a) = T_A$ and $T(x=L) = T_B$.

The analytical solution is not difficult here: $T = T_A-\frac{T_A-T_B}{L}x$, but we will solve this by finite differences.

For this problem, lets consider a slab that is defined by x=0 to x=L, with $T(x=0) = 100$, and $T(x=L) = 200$. We want to find the function T(x) inside the slab.

We approximate the second derivative by finite differences as

\( f''(x) \approx \frac{f(x-h) - 2 f(x) + f(x+h)}{h^2} \)

Since the second derivative in this case is equal to zero, we have at each discretized node $0 = T_{i-1} - 2 T_i + T_{i+1}$. We know the values of $T_{x=0} = \alpha$ and $T_{x=L} = \beta$.

\[A = \left [ \begin{array}{ccccc} %
 -2         & 1 & 0                    & 0 & 0 \\
1           & -2& 1 & 0 & 0 \\

0                    & 0                    & 0  & 1  & -2  \end{array} \right ] \]

\[ b = \left [ \begin{array}{c} -T(x=0) \\
0 \\
\vdots \\
0 \\
-T(x=L) \end{array} \right] \]

These are linear equations in the unknowns $x$ that we can easily solve. Here, we evaluate the solution.

We want to solve $y''(x) = -3 y(x) y'(x)$ with $y(0) = 0 and $y(2) = 1$ using a finite difference method. We discretize the region and approximate the derivatives as:

\(y''(x) \approx \frac{y_{i-1} - 2 y_i + y_{i+1}}{h^2} \)

\(y'(x) \approx \frac{y_{i+1} - y_{i-1}}{2 h} \)

We define a function $y''(x) = F(x, y, y')$. At each node in our discretized region, we will have an equation that looks like $y''(x) - F(x, y, y') = 0$, which will be nonlinear in the unknown solution $y$. The set of equations to solve is:

\begin{eqnarray}
y_0 - \alpha &=& 0 \\
\frac{y_{i-1} - 2 y_i + y_{i+1}}{h^2} + (3 y_i) (\frac{y_{i+1} - y_{i-1}}{2 h}) &=& 0 \\
y_L - \beta &=&0
\end{eqnarray}

Since we use a nonlinear solver, we will have to provide an initial guess to the solution. We will in this case assume a line. In other cases, a bad initial guess may lead to no solution.

Boundary value problems may have more than one solution. Let us consider the BVP:

\begin{eqnarray}
y'' + |y| &=& 0 \\
y(0) &=& 0 \\
y(4) &=& -2
\end{eqnarray}

We will see this equation has two answers, depending on your initial guess. We convert this to the following set of coupled equations:

\begin{eqnarray}
y_1' &=& y_2 \\
y_2' &=& -|y_1| \\
y_1(0)&=& 0\\
y_1(4) &=& -2
\end{eqnarray}

This BVP is nonlinear because of the absolute value. We will have to guess solutions to get started. We will guess two different solutions, both of which will be constant values.  We will use pycse.bvp to solve the equation.

This example shows that a nonlinear BVP may have different solutions, and which one you get depends on the guess you make for the solution. This is analogous to solving nonlinear algebraic equations (which is what is done in solving this problem!).

In fluid mechanics the Blasius equation comes up (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blasius_boundary_layer) to describe the boundary layer that forms near a flat plate with fluid moving by it. The nonlinear differential equation is:

\begin{eqnarray}
f''' + \frac{1}{2} f f'' &=& 0 \\
f(0) &=& 0 \\
f'(0) &=& 0 \\
f'(\infty) &=& 1
\end{eqnarray}

This is a nonlinear, boundary value problem. The point of solving this equation is to get the value of $f''(0)$ to evaluate the shear stress at the plate.

We have to convert this to a system of first-order differential equations. Let $f_1 = f$, $f_2 = f_1'$ and $f_3 = f_2'$. This leads to:

\begin{eqnarray}
f_1' = f_2 \\
f_2' = f_3 \\
f_3' = -\frac{1}{2} f_1 f_3 \\
f_1(0) = 0 \\
f_2(0) = 0 \\
f_2(\infty) = 1
\end{eqnarray}

It is not possible to specify a boundary condition at $\infty$ numerically, so we will have to use a large number, and verify it is "large enough". From the solution, we evaluate the derivatives at $\eta=0$, and we have $f''(0) = f_3(0)$.

We have to provide initial guesses for f_1, f_2 and f_3. This is the hardest part about this problem. We know that f_1 starts at zero, and is flat there (f'(0)=0), but at large eta, it has a constant slope of one. We will guess a simple line of slope = 1 for f_1. That is correct at large eta, and is zero at \eta=0. If the slope of the function is constant at large $\eta$, then the values of higher derivatives must tend to zero. We choose an exponential decay as a guess.

Finally, we let a solver iteratively find a solution for us, and find the answer we want. The solver is in the pycse module.

The PDE that describes the transient behavior of a plug flow reactor with constant volumetric flow rate is:

\( \frac{\partial C_A}{\partial dt} = -\nu_0 \frac{\partial C_A}{\partial dV} + r_A \).

To solve this numerically in python, we will utilize the method of lines. The idea is to discretize the reactor in volume, and approximate the spatial derivatives by finite differences. Then we will have a set of coupled ordinary differential equations that can be solved in the usual way. Let us simplify the notation with $C = C_A$, and let $r_A = -k C^2$. Graphically this looks like this:

[[./images/pde-method-of-lines.png]]

This leads to the following set of equations:

\begin{eqnarray}
\frac{dC_0}{dt} &=& 0 \text{ (entrance concentration never changes)} \\
\frac{dC_1}{dt} &=& -\nu_0 \frac{C_1 - C_0}{V_1 - V_0} - k C_1^2 \\
\frac{dC_2}{dt} &=& -\nu_0 \frac{C_2 - C_1}{V_2 - V_1} - k C_2^2 \\
\vdots \\
\frac{dC_4}{dt} &=& -\nu_0 \frac{C_4 - C_3}{V_4 - V_3} - k C_4^2
\end{eqnarray}

Last, we need initial conditions for all the nodes in the discretization. Let us assume the reactor was full of empty solvent, so that $C_i = 0$ at $t=0$. In the next block of code, we get the transient solutions, and the steady state solution.
#+BEGIN_SRC python :session

There is some minor disagreement between the final transient solution and the steady state solution. That is due to the approximation in discretizing the reactor volume. In this example we used 100 nodes. You get better agreement with a larger number of nodes, say 200 or more. Of course, it takes slightly longer to compute then, since the number of coupled odes is equal to the number of nodes.

We can also create an animated gif to show how the concentration of A throughout the reactor varies with time. Note, I had to install ffmpeg (http://ffmpeg.org/) to save the animation.

We solved a steady state BVP modeling heat conduction. Today we examine the transient behavior of a rod at constant T put between two heat reservoirs at different temperatures, again T1 = 100, and T2 = 200. The rod will start at 150. Over time, we should expect a solution that approaches the steady state solution: a linear temperature profile from one side of the rod to the other.

$\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = k \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2}$

at $t=0$, in this example we have $u_0(x) = 150$ as an initial condition. with boundary conditions $u(0,t)=100$ and $u(L,t)=200$.

In Matlab there is the pdepe command. There is not yet a PDE solver in scipy. Instead, we will utilze the method of lines to solve this problem. We discretize the rod into segments, and approximate the second derivative in the spatial dimension as $\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2} = (u(x + h) - 2 u(x) + u(x-h))/ h^2$ at each node. This leads to a set of coupled ordinary differential equations that is easy to solve.

Let us say the rod has a length of 1, $k=0.02$, and solve for the time-dependent temperature profiles.

This version of the graphical solution is not that easy to read, although with some study you can see the solution evolves from the initial condition which is flat, to the steady state solution which is a linear temperature ramp.

The 3d version may be easier to interpret. The temperature profile starts out flat, and gradually changes to the linear ramp.

We want to solve for the concentration profile of  component that diffuses into a 1D rod, with an impermeable barrier at the end. The PDE governing this situation is:

$\frac{\partial C}{\partial t} = D \frac{\partial^2 C}{\partial x^2}$

at $t=0$, in this example we have $C_0(x) = 0$ as an initial condition, with boundary conditions $C(0,t)=0.1$ and $\partial C/ \partial x(L,t)=0$.

We are going to discretize this equation in both time and space to arrive at the solution. We will let $i$ be the index for the spatial discretization, and $j$ be the index for the temporal discretization. The discretization looks like this.

[[./images/pde-diffusion-discretization-scheme.png]]

Note that we cannot use the method of lines as we did before because we have the derivative-based boundary condition at one of the boundaries.

We approximate the time derivative as:

\(\frac{\partial C}{\partial t} \bigg| _{i,j} \approx \frac{C_{i,j+1} - C_{i,j}}{\Delta t} \)

\(\frac{\partial^2 C}{\partial  x^2} \bigg| _{i,j} \approx \frac{C_{i+1,j} - 2 C_{i,j} + C_{i-1,j}}{h^2} \)

We define $\alpha = \frac{D \Delta t}{h^2}$, and from these two approximations and the PDE, we solve for the unknown solution at a later time step as:

\(C_{i, j+1} = \alpha C_{i+1,j} + (1 - 2 \alpha) C_{i,j}  + \alpha C_{i-1,j} \)

We know $C_{i,j=0}$ from the initial conditions, so we simply need to iterate to evaluate $C_{i,j}$, which is the solution at each time step.

The solution is somewhat sensitive to the choices of time step and spatial discretization. If you make the time step too big, the method is not stable, and large oscillations may occur.

*** setting all the text properties in a figure.

You may notice the axis tick labels are not consistent with the labels now. If you have many plots it can be tedious to try setting each text property. Python to the rescue! With these commands you can find all the text instances, and change them all at one time! Likewise, you can change all the lines, and all the axes.

Sometimes you will have two datasets you want to plot together, but the scales will be so different it is hard to seem them both in the same plot. Here we examine a few strategies to plotting this kind of data.

*** Make two plots!

this certainly solves the problem, but you have two full size plots, which can take up a lot of space in a presentation and report. Often your goal in plotting both data sets is to compare them, and it is easiest to compare plots when they are perfectly lined up. Doing that manually can be tedious.

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session

*** Scaling the results

Sometimes you can scale one dataset so it has a similar magnitude as the other data set. Here we could multiply y2 by 100, and then it will be similar in size to y1. Of course, you need to indicate that y2 has been scaled in the graph somehow. Here we use the legend.

*** Double-y axis plot
[[index:plot!double y-axis]]

Using two separate y-axes can solve your scaling problem. Note that each y-axis is color coded to the data. It can be difficult to read these graphs when printed in black and white

It is an unknown fact that Picasso had a brief blue plotting period with Matlab before moving on to his more famous paintings. It started from irritation with the default colors available in Matlab for plotting. After watching his friend van Gogh cut off his own ear out of frustration with the ugly default colors, Picasso had to do something different.

plt.savefig('images/blues-1.png')
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:

[[./images/blues-1.png]]

Picasso copied the table available at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_colors and parsed it into a dictionary of hex codes for new colors. That allowed him to specify a list of beautiful blues for his graph. Picasso eventually gave up on python as an artform, and moved on to painting.

One basic event a figure can react to is a mouse click. Let us make a graph with a parabola in it, and draw the shortest line from a point clicked on to the graph. Here is an example of doing that.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
from scipy.optimize import fmin_cobyla

fig = plt.figure()

def f(x):
    return x**2

x = np.linspace(-2, 2)
y = f(x)

ax = fig.add_subplot(111)
ax.plot(x, y)
ax.set_title('Click somewhere')

def onclick(event):
    ax = plt.gca()

    P = (event.xdata, event.ydata)

    def objective(X):
	x,y = X
	return np.sqrt((x - P[0])**2 + (y - P[1])**2)

    def c1(X):
	x,y = X
	return f(x) - y

    X = fmin_cobyla(objective, x0=[P[0], f(P[0])], cons=[c1])

    ax.set_title('x={0:1.2f} y={1:1.2f}'.format(event.xdata, event.ydata))
    ax.plot([event.xdata, X[0]], [event.ydata, X[1]], 'ro-')
    ax.figure.canvas.draw()  # this line is critical to change the title
    plt.savefig('images/interactive-basic-click.png')

cid = fig.canvas.mpl_connect('button_press_event', onclick)
plt.show()
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:


Here is the result from two clicks. For some reason, this only works when you click inside the parabola. It does not work outside the parabola.

[[./images/interactive-basic-click.png]]

We can even do different things with different mouse clicks. A left click corresponds to event.button = 1, a middle click is event.button = 2, and a right click is event.button = 3. You can detect if a double click occurs too. Here is an example of these different options.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

fig = plt.figure()

ax = fig.add_subplot(111)
ax.plot(np.random.rand(10))
ax.set_title('Click somewhere')

def onclick(event):
    ax.set_title('x={0:1.2f} y={1:1.2f} button={2}'.format(event.xdata, event.ydata, event.button))
    colors = ' rbg'
    print('button={0} (dblclick={2}). making a {1} dot'.format(event.button,
							       colors[event.button],
							       event.dblclick))

    ms=5 # marker size
    if event.dblclick: #make marker bigger
	ms = 10

    ax.plot([event.xdata], [event.ydata], 'o', color=colors[event.button], ms=ms)
    ax.figure.canvas.draw()  # this line is critical to change the title
    plt.savefig('images/interactive-button-click.png')

cid = fig.canvas.mpl_connect('button_press_event', onclick)
plt.show()
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: button=1 (dblclick=0). making a r dot
: button=1 (dblclick=0). making a r dot
: button=1 (dblclick=1). making a r dot
: button=3 (dblclick=0). making a g dot
: button=3 (dblclick=0). making a g dot
: button=3 (dblclick=1). making a g dot

Finally, you may want to have key modifiers for your clicks, e.g. Ctrl-click is different than a click.

You can have almost every key-click combination imaginable. This allows you to have many different things that can happen when you click on a graph. With this method, you can get the coordinates close to a data point, but you do not get the properties of the point. For that, we need another mechanism.

*** Mouse movement
In this example, we will let the mouse motion move a point up and down a curve. This might be helpful to explore a function graph, for example. We use interpolation to estimate the curve between data points.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
from scipy.interpolate import interp1d

# the "data"
x = np.linspace(0, np.pi)
y = np.sin(x)

# interpolating function between points
p = interp1d(x, y, 'cubic')

# make the figure
fig = plt.figure()

ax = fig.add_subplot(111)
line, = ax.plot(x, y, 'ro-')
marker, = ax.plot([0.5], [0.5],'go',  ms=15)

ax.set_title('Move the mouse around')

def onmove(event):

    xe = event.xdata
    ye = event.ydata

    ax.set_title('at x={0}  y={1}'.format(xe, p(xe)))
    marker.set_xdata(xe)
    marker.set_ydata(p(xe))

    ax.figure.canvas.draw()  # this line is critical to change the title

cid = fig.canvas.mpl_connect('motion_notify_event', onmove)

** Peak annotation in matplotlib

This post is just some examples of annotating features in a plot in matplotlib. We illustrate finding peak maxima in a range, shading a region, shading peaks, and labeling a region of peaks. I find it difficult to remember the detailed syntax for these, so here are examples I could refer to later.

Python provides a sum function to compute the sum of a list. However, the sum function does not work on every arrangement of numbers, and it certainly does not work on nested lists. We will solve this problem with recursion.

Here is a simple example.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
v = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] # a list
print(sum(v))

v = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9)  # a tuple
print(sum(v))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: 45
: 45

If you have data in a dictionary, sum works by default on the keys. You can give the sum function the values like this.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
v = {'a':1, 'b':3, 'c':4}
print(sum(v.values()))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: 8

*** Nested lists

Suppose now we have nested lists. This kind of structured data might come up if you had grouped several things together. For example, suppose we have 5 departments, with 1, 5, 15, 7 and 17 people in them, and in each department they are divided into groups.

Department 1: 1 person
Department 2: group of 2 and group of 3
Department 3: group of 4 and 11, with a subgroups of 5 and 6 making
	      up the group of 11.
Department 4: 7 people
Department 5: one group of 8 and one group of 9.

We might represent the data like this nested list. Now, if we want to compute the total number of people, we need to add up each group. We cannot simply sum the list, because some elements are single numbers, and others are lists, or lists of lists. We need to recurse through each entry until we get down to a number, which we can add to the running sum.
#+BEGIN_SRC python
v = [1,
    [2, 3],
    [4, [5, 6]],
    7,
    [8,9]]

def recursive_sum(X):
    'compute sum of arbitrarily nested lists'
    s = 0 # initial value of the sum

    for i in range(len(X)):
	import types  # we use this to test if we got a number
	if isinstance(X[i], (int, float, complex)):
	    # this is the terminal step
	    s += X[i]
	else:
	    # we did not get a number, so we recurse
	    s += recursive_sum(X[i])
    return s

print(recursive_sum(v))
print(recursive_sum([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9])) # test on non-nested list
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: 45
: 45

In [[http://matlab.cheme.cmu.edu/2012/05/28/lather-rinse-and-repeat/][Post 1970]] we examined recursive functions that could be replaced by loops. Here we examine a function that can only work with recursion because the nature of the nested data structure is arbitrary. There are arbitrary branches and depth in the data structure. Recursion is nice because you do not have to define that structure in advance.

: sorted a =  [8, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
: a        =  [4, 5, 1, 6, 8, 3, 2]

This works for strings too:

#+BEGIN_SRC python
a = ['b', 'a', 'c', 'tree']
print(sorted(a))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: ['a', 'b', 'c', 'tree']

Here is a subtle point though. A capitalized letter comes before a lowercase letter. We can pass a function to the sorted command that is called on each element prior to the sort. Here we make each word lower case before sorting.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
a = ['B', 'a', 'c', 'tree']
print(sorted(a))

# sort by lower case letter
print(sorted(a, key=str.lower))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: ['B', 'a', 'c', 'tree']
: ['a', 'B', 'c', 'tree']

Here is a more complex sorting problem. We have a list of tuples with group names and the letter grade. We want to sort the list by the letter grades. We do this by creating a function that maps the letter grades to the position of the letter grades in a sorted list. We use the list.index function to find the index of the letter grade, and then sort on that.

#+BEGIN_SRC python

groups = [('group1', 'B'),
	  ('group2', 'A+'),
	  ('group3', 'A')]

def grade_key(gtup):
    '''gtup is a tuple of ('groupname', 'lettergrade')'''
    lettergrade = gtup[1]

    grades = ['A++', 'A+', 'A', 'A-', 'A/B'
	      'B+', 'B', 'B-', 'B/C',
	      'C+', 'C', 'C-', 'C/D',
	      'D+', 'D', 'D-', 'D/R',
	      'R+', 'R', 'R-', 'R--']

    return grades.index(lettergrade)

print(sorted(groups, key=grade_key))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: [('group2', 'A+'), ('group3', 'A'), ('group1', 'B')]

It is surprising how often you need to know only the unique entries in a vector of entries. In python, we create a "set" from a list, which only contains unique entries. Then we convert the set back to a list.

Recursive functions are functions that call themselves repeatedly until some exit condition is met. Today we look at a classic example of recursive function for computing a factorial. The factorial of a non-negative integer n is denoted n!, and is defined as the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n.

The key ideas in defining a recursive function is that there needs to be some logic to identify when to terminate the function. Then, you need logic that calls the function again, but with a smaller part of the problem. Here we recursively call the function with n-1 until it gets called with n=0. 0! is defined to be 1.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
def recursive_factorial(n):
    '''compute the factorial recursively. Note if you put a negative
    number in, this function will never end. We also do not check if
    n is an integer.'''
    if n == 0:
	return 1
    else:
	return n * recursive_factorial(n - 1)

print(recursive_factorial(5))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: 120

#+BEGIN_SRC python
from scipy.misc import factorial
print(factorial(5))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: 120.0

**** Compare to a loop solution

This example can also be solved by a loop. This loop is easier to read and understand than the recursive function. Note the recursive nature of defining the variable as itself times a number.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
n = 5
factorial_loop = 1
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    factorial_loop *= i

print(factorial_loop)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: 120

There are some significant differences in this example than in Matlab.

  1. the syntax of the for loop is quite different with the use of the =in= operator.
  2. python has the nice *= operator to replace a = a * i
  3. We have to loop from 1 to n+1 because the last number in the range is not returned.

*** Conclusions

Recursive functions have a special niche in mathematical programming. There is often another way to accomplish the same goal. That is not always true though, and in a future post we will examine cases where recursion is the only way to solve a problem.
** Brief intro to regular expressions

This example shows how to use a regular expression to find strings matching the pattern :cmd:`datastring`. We want to find these strings, and then replace them with something that depends on what cmd is, and what datastring is.

Let us define some commands that will take datasring as an argument, and return the modified text. The idea is to find all the cmds, and then run them. We use python's =eval= command to get the function handle from a string, and the cmd functions all take a datastring argument (we define them that way). We will create commands to replace :cmd:`datastring` with html code for a light gray background, and :red:`some text` with html code making the text red.

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session
text = r'''Here is some text. use the :cmd:`open` to get the text into
	  a variable. It might also be possible to get a multiline
	    :red:`line
     2` directive.'''

print(text)
print('---------------------------------')
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: Here is some text. use the :cmd:`open` to get the text into
:           a variable. It might also be possible to get a multiline
:             :red:`line
:      2` directive.
: ---------------------------------

Now, we define our functions.
#+BEGIN_SRC python :session
def cmd(datastring):
    ' replace :cmd:`datastring` with html code with light gray background'
    s = '<FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: LightGray">%{0}</FONT>';
    html = s.format(datastring)
    return html

def red(datastring):
    'replace :red:`datastring` with html code to make datastring in red font'
    html = '<font color=red>{0}</font>'.format(datastring)
    return html
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:

Finally, we do the regular expression. Regular expressions are hard. There are whole books on them. The point of this post is to alert you to the possibilities. I will break this regexp down as follows. 1. we want everything between :*: as the directive. =([^:]*)= matches everything not a :. =:([^:]*):= matches the stuff between two :. 2. then we want everything between `*`. =([^`]*)= matches everything not a `. 3. The () makes a group that python stores so we can refer to them later.
#+BEGIN_SRC python :session
import re
regex = ':([^:]*):`([^`]*)`'
matches = re.findall(regex, text)
for directive, datastring in matches:
    directive = eval(directive) # get the function
    text = re.sub(regex, directive(datastring), text)

print('Modified text:')
print(text)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: Modified text:
: Here is some text. use the <FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: LightGray">%open</FONT> to get the text into
:           a variable. It might also be possible to get a multiline

It is not too uncommon to have a list of data, and then to apply a function to every element, to filter the list, or extract elements that meet some criteria. In this example, we take a string and split it into words. Then, we will examine several ways to apply functions to the words, to filter the list to get data that meets some criteria. Here is the string splitting.

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session

 As we have seen, handling units with third party functions is fragile, and often requires additional code to wrap the function to handle the units. An alternative approach that avoids the wrapping is to rescale the equations so they are dimensionless. Then, we should be able to use all the standard external functions without modification. We obtain the final solutions by rescaling back to the answers we want.

Before doing the examples, let us consider how the quantities package handles dimensionless numbers.

import quantities as u

a = 5 * u.m
L = 10 * u.m # characteristic length

print a/L
print type(a/L)

Let us get the length of each word.

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session

Now let us get all the words that start with the letter "a". This is sometimes called filtering a list. We use a string function =startswith= to check for upper and lower-case letters. We will use list comprehension with a condition.

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session
print([word for word in words if word.startswith('a') or word.startswith('A')])

# make word lowercase to simplify the conditional statement
print([word for word in words if word.lower().startswith('a')])
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: ['As', 'and', 'additional', 'An', 'alternative', 'approach', 'avoids', 'are', 'able', 'all', 'answers', 'as', 'a', 'a/L']
: ['As', 'and', 'additional', 'An', 'alternative', 'approach', 'avoids', 'are', 'able', 'all', 'answers', 'as', 'a', 'a/L']

A slightly harder example is to find all the words that are actually numbers. We could use a regular expression for that, but we will instead use a function we create. We use a function that tries to cast a word as a float. If this fails, we know the word is not a float, so we return False.

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session
def float_p(word):
    try:
	float(word)
	return True
    except ValueError:
	return False

print([word for word in words if float_p(word)])

# here is a functional approach
print(list(filter(float_p, words)))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: ['5', '10']
: ['5', '10']

Finally, we consider filtering the list to find all words that contain certain symbols, say any character in this string "./=*#". Any of those characters will do, so we search each word for one of them, and return True if it contains it, and False if none are contained.
#+BEGIN_SRC python :session
def punctuation_p(word):
    S = './=*#'
    for s in S:
	if s in word:
	    return True
    return False

print([word for word in words if punctuation_p(word)])
print(filter(punctuation_p, words))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: ['units.', 'dimensionless.', 'modification.', 'want.', 'numbers.', '=', '*', 'u.m', '=', '*', 'u.m', '#', 'a/L', 'type(a/L)']
: <filter object at 0x11034b780>

In this section we examined a few ways to interact with lists using list comprehension and functional programming. These approaches make it possible to work on arbitrary size lists, without needing to know in advance how big the lists are. New lists are automatically generated as results, without the need to preallocate lists, i.e. you do not need to know the size of the output. This can be handy as it avoids needing to write loops in some cases and leads to more compact code.

There may be a time where you have an Excel sheet that already has a model built into it, and you normally change cells in the sheet, and it solves the model. It can be tedious to do that a lot, and we can use python to do that. Python has a COM interface that can communicate with Excel (and many other windows programs. see http://my.safaribooksonline.com/1565926218 for Python Programming on Win32). In this example, we will use a very simple Excel sheet that calculates the volume of a CSTR that runs a zeroth order reaction ($-r_A = k$) for a particular conversion. You set the conversion in the cell B1, and the volume is automatically computed in cell B6. We simply need to set the value of B1, and get the value of B6 for a range of different conversion values. In this example, the volume is returned in Liters.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
import win32com.client as win32
excel = win32.Dispatch('Excel.Application')

wb = excel.Workbooks.Open('c:/Users/jkitchin/Dropbox/pycse/data/cstr-zeroth-order.xlsx')
ws = wb.Worksheets('Sheet1')

X = [0.1, 0.5, 0.9]
for x in X:
    ws.Range("B1").Value = x
    V = ws.Range("B6").Value
    print 'at X = {0} V = {1:1.2f} L'.format(x, V)

# we tell Excel the workbook is saved, even though it is not, so it
# will quit without asking us to save.
excel.ActiveWorkbook.Saved = True
excel.Application.Quit()
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: at X = 0.1 V = 22.73 L
: at X = 0.5 V = 113.64 L
: at X = 0.9 V = 204.55 L

This was a simple example (one that did not actually need Excel at all) that illustrates the feasibility of communicating with Excel via a COM interface.

Aspen is a process modeling tool that simulates industrial processes. It has a GUI for setting up the flowsheet, defining all the stream inputs and outputs, and for running the simulation. For single calculations it is pretty convenient. For many calculations, all the pointing and clicking to change properties can be tedious, and difficult to reproduce. Here we show how to use Python to automate Aspen using the COM interface.

We have an Aspen flowsheet setup for a flash operation. The feed consists of 91.095 mol% water and 8.905 mol% ethanol at 100 degF and 50 psia. 48.7488 lbmol/hr of the mixture is fed to the flash tank which is at 150 degF and 20 psia. We want to know the composition of the VAPOR and LIQUID streams. The simulation has been run once.

[[./images/flash-flowsheet.png]]

This is an example that just illustrates it is possible to access data from a simulation that has been run. You have to know quite a bit about the Aspen flowsheet before writing this code. Particularly, you need to open the Variable Explorer to find the "path" to the variables that you want, and to know what the units are of those variables are.

It is nice that we can read data from a simulation, but it would be helpful if we could change variable values and to rerun the simulations. That is possible. We simply set the value of the variable, and tell Aspen to rerun. Here, we will change the temperature of the Flash tank and plot the composition of the outlet streams as a function of that temperature.

It takes about 30 seconds to run the previous example. Unfortunately, the way it is written, if you want to change anything, you have to run all of the calculations over again. How to avoid that is moderately tricky, and will be the subject of another example.

In summary, it seems possible to do a lot with Aspen automation via python. This can also be done with Matlab, Excel, and other programming languages where COM automation is possible. The COM interface is not especially well documented, and you have to do a lot of digging to figure out some things. It is not clear how committed Aspen is to maintaining or improving the COM interface (http://www.chejunkie.com/aspen-plus/aspen-plus-activex-automation-server/). Hopefully they can keep it alive for power users who do not want to program in Excel!

One reason to interact with Aspen via python is to use external solvers to drive the simulations. Aspen has some built-in solvers, but it does not have everything. You may also want to integrate additional calculations, e.g. capital costs, water usage, etc... and integrate those results into a report.

Here is a simple example where we use fsolve to find the temperature of the flash tank that will give a vapor phase mole fraction of ethanol of 0.8. It is a simple example, but it illustrates the possibility.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
import os
import win32com.client as win32
aspen = win32.Dispatch('Apwn.Document')

aspen.InitFromArchive2(os.path.abspath('data\Flash_Example.bkp'))

from scipy.optimize import fsolve

def func(flashT):
    flashT = float(flashT) # COM objects do not understand numpy types
    aspen.Tree.FindNode('\Data\Blocks\FLASH\Input\TEMP').Value = flashT
    aspen.Engine.Run2()
    y = aspen.Tree.FindNode('\Data\Streams\VAPOR\Output\MOLEFRAC\MIXED\ETHANOL').Value
    return y - 0.8

sol, = fsolve(func, 150.0)
print 'A flash temperature of {0:1.2f} degF will have y_ethanol = 0.8'.format(sol)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: A flash temperature of 157.38 degF will have y_ethanol = 0.8

One unexpected detail was that the Aspen COM objects cannot be assigned numpy number types, so it was necessary to recast the argument as a float. Otherwise, this worked about as expected for an fsolve problem.

Ordinarily a print statement prints to stdout, or your terminal/screen. You can redirect this so that printing is done to a file, for example. This might be helpful if you use print statements for debugging, and later want to save what is printed to a file. Here we make a simple function that prints some things.

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session
def debug():
    print('step 1')
    print(3 + 4)
    print('finished')

debug()
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: step 1
: 7
: finished

Now, let us redirect the printed lines to a file. We create a file object, and set sys.stdout equal to that file object.
#+BEGIN_SRC python :session
import sys
print('__stdout__ before = {0}'.format(sys.__stdout__), file=sys.stdout)
print('stdout before = {0}'.format(sys.stdout), file=sys.stdout)

f = open('data/debug.txt', 'w')
sys.stdout = f

# note that sys.__stdout__ does not change, but stdout does.
print('__stdout__ after = {0}'.format(sys.__stdout__), file=sys.stdout)
print('stdout after = {0}'.format(sys.stdout), file=sys.stdout)

debug()

# reset stdout back to console
sys.stdout = sys.__stdout__

print(f)
f.close() # try to make it a habit to close files
print(f)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: __stdout__ before = <_io.TextIOWrapper name='<stdout>' mode='w' encoding='UTF-8'>
: stdout before = <_io.TextIOWrapper name='<stdout>' mode='w' encoding='UTF-8'>
: <_io.TextIOWrapper name='data/debug.txt' mode='w' encoding='UTF-8'>
: <_io.TextIOWrapper name='data/debug.txt' mode='w' encoding='UTF-8'>

Note it can be important to close files. If you are looping through large numbers of files, you will eventually run out of file handles, causing an error. We can use a context manager to automatically close the file like this

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session
import sys

# use the open context manager to automatically close the file
with open('data/debug.txt', 'w') as f:
    sys.stdout = f
    debug()
    print(f, file=sys.__stdout__)

# reset stdout
sys.stdout = sys.__stdout__
print(f)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: <_io.TextIOWrapper name='data/debug.txt' mode='w' encoding='UTF-8'>
: <_io.TextIOWrapper name='data/debug.txt' mode='w' encoding='UTF-8'>

See, the file is closed for us! We can see the contents of our file like this.
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
cat data/debug.txt
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: step 1
: 7
: finished

The approaches above are not fault safe. Suppose our debug function raised an exception. Then, it could be possible the line to reset the stdout would not be executed. We can solve this with try/finally code.

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session
import sys

print('before: ', sys.stdout)
try:
    with open('data/debug-2.txt', 'w') as f:
	sys.stdout = f
	# print to the original stdout
	print('during: ', sys.stdout, file=sys.__stdout__)
	debug()
	raise Exception('something bad happened')
finally:
    # reset stdout
    sys.stdout = sys.__stdout__

print('after: ', sys.stdout)
print(f) # verify it is closed
print(sys.stdout) # verify this is reset
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: before:  <_io.TextIOWrapper name='<stdout>' mode='w' encoding='UTF-8'>
: during:  <_io.TextIOWrapper name='data/debug-2.txt' mode='w' encoding='UTF-8'>
: Traceback (most recent call last):

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
cat data/debug-2.txt
#+END_SRC

This is the kind of situation where a context manager is handy. Context managers are typically a class that executes some code when you "enter" the context, and then execute some code when you "exit" the context. Here we want to change sys.stdout to a new value inside our context, and change it back when we exit the context. We will store the value of sys.stdout going in, and restore it on the way out.

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session
import sys

class redirect:
    def __init__(self, f=sys.stdout):
	"redirect print statement to f. f must be a file-like object"
	self.f = f
	self.stdout = sys.stdout
	print('init stdout: ', sys.stdout, file=sys.__stdout__)
    def __enter__(self):
	sys.stdout = self.f
	print('stdout in context-manager: ',sys.stdout, f=sys.__stdout__)
    def __exit__(self, *args):
	sys.stdout = self.stdout
	print('__stdout__ at exit = ',sys.__stdout__)

# regular printing
with redirect():
    debug()

# write to a file
with open('data/debug-3.txt', 'w') as f:
    with redirect(f):
	debug()

# mixed regular and
with open('data/debug-4.txt', 'w') as f:
    with redirect(f):
	print('testing redirect')
	with redirect():
	    print('temporary console printing')
	    debug()
	print('Now outside the inner context. This should go to data/debug-4.txt')
	debug()
	raise Exception('something else bad happened')

print(sys.stdout)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:

Here are the contents of the debug file.
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
cat data/debug-3.txt
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:

The contents of the other debug file have some additional lines, because we printed some things while in the redirect context.
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
cat data/debug-4.txt
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:

See http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0343/ (number 5) for another example of redirecting using a function decorator. I think it is harder to understand, because it uses a generator.

There were a couple of points in this section:

1. You can control where things are printed in your programs by modifying the value of sys.stdout
2. You can use try/except/finally blocks to make sure code gets executed in the event an exception is raised
3. You can use context managers to make sure files get closed, and code gets executed if exceptions are raised.

** Getting a dictionary of counts

I frequently want to take a list and get a dictionary of keys that have the count of each element in the list. Here is how I have typically done this countless times in the past.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
L = ['a', 'a', 'b','d', 'e', 'b', 'e', 'a']

d = {}
for el in L:
    if el in d:
	d[el] += 1
    else:
	d[el] = 1

print(d)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: {'b': 2, 'a': 3, 'e': 2, 'd': 1}

That seems like too much code, and that there must be a list comprehension approach combined with a dictionary constructor.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
L = ['a', 'a', 'b','d', 'e', 'b', 'e', 'a']

print(dict((el,L.count(el)) for el in L))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: {'b': 2, 'a': 3, 'd': 1, 'e': 2}

Wow, that is a lot simpler! I suppose for large lists this might be slow, since count must look through the list for each element, whereas the longer code looks at each element once, and does one conditional analysis.

Here is another example of much shorter and cleaner code.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
from collections import Counter
L = ['a', 'a', 'b','d', 'e', 'b', 'e', 'a']
print(Counter(L))
print(Counter(L)['a'])
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: Counter({'a': 3, 'e': 2, 'b': 2, 'd': 1})
: 3

If you are doing some analysis that requires you to change directories, e.g. to read a file, and then change back to another directory to read another file, you have probably run into problems if there is an error somewhere. You would like to make sure that the code changes back to the original directory after each error. We will look at a few ways to accomplish that here.

The try/except/finally method is the traditional way to handle exceptions, and make sure that some code "finally" runs. Let us look at two examples here. In the first example, we try to change into a directory that does not exist.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
import os, sys

CWD = os.getcwd() # store initial position
print('initially inside {0}'.format(os.getcwd()))
TEMPDIR = 'data/run1' # this does not exist

try:
    os.chdir(TEMPDIR)
    print('inside {0}'.format(os.getcwd()))
except:
    print('Exception caught: ',sys.exc_info()[0])
finally:
    print('Running final code')
    os.chdir(CWD)
    print('finally inside {0}'.format(os.getcwd()))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: initially inside /Users/jkitchin/Dropbox/books/pycse
: Exception caught:  <class 'FileNotFoundError'>
: Running final code
: finally inside /Users/jkitchin/Dropbox/books/pycse


Now, let us look at an example where the directory does exist. We will change into the directory, run some code, and then raise an Exception.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
import os, sys

CWD = os.getcwd() # store initial position
print('initially inside {0}'.format(os.getcwd()))
TEMPDIR = 'data'

try:
    os.chdir(TEMPDIR)
    print('inside {0}'.format(os.getcwd()))
    print(os.listdir('.'))
    raise Exception('boom')
except:
    print('Exception caught: ',sys.exc_info()[0])
finally:
    print('Running final code')
    os.chdir(CWD)
    print('finally inside {0}'.format(os.getcwd()))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: initially inside /Users/jkitchin/Dropbox/books/pycse
: inside /Users/jkitchin/Dropbox/books/pycse/data
: ['_0308azw.def', '_BaEA1C.tmp', 'antoine_data.dat', 'antoine_database.mat', 'commonshellsettings.xml', 'cstr-zeroth-order.xlsx', 'data.pckl', 'debug-2.txt', 'debug-3.txt', 'debug-4.txt', 'debug.txt', 'example.xlsx', 'example2.xls', 'example3.xls', 'example4.xls', 'example4.xlsx', 'Flash_Example.apw', 'Flash_Example.bkp', 'Flash_Example.def', 'gc-data-21.txt', 'memoize-aspen.pkl', 'PT.txt', 'raman.txt', 'run2', 'test.docx', 'testdata.txt']
: Exception caught:  <class 'Exception'>
: Running final code
: finally inside /Users/jkitchin/Dropbox/books/pycse

You can see that we changed into the directory, ran some code, and then caught an exception. Afterwards, we changed back to our original directory. This code works fine, but it is somewhat verbose, and tedious to write over and over. We can get a cleaner syntax with a context manager. The context manager uses the =with= keyword in python. In a context manager some code is executed on entering the "context", and code is run on exiting the context. We can use that to automatically change directory, and when done, change back to the original directory. We use the =contextlib.contextmanager= decorator on a function. With a function, the code up to a =yield= statement is run on entering the context, and the code after the yield statement is run on exiting. We wrap the yield statement in try/except/finally block to make sure our final code gets run.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
import contextlib
import os, sys

@contextlib.contextmanager
def cd(path):
    print('initially inside {0}'.format(os.getcwd()))
    CWD = os.getcwd()

    os.chdir(path)
    print('inside {0}'.format(os.getcwd()))
    try:
	yield
    except:
	print('Exception caught: ',sys.exc_info()[0])
    finally:
	print('finally inside {0}'.format(os.getcwd()))
	os.chdir(CWD)

# Now we use the context manager
with cd('data'):
    print(os.listdir('.'))
    raise Exception('boom')

print
with cd('data/run2'):
    print(os.listdir('.'))
#+END_SRC

One case that is not handled well with this code is if the directory you want to change into does not exist. In that case an exception is raised on entering the context when you try change into a directory that does not exist. An alternative class based context manager can be found [[http://code.activestate.com/recipes/576620-changedirectory-context-manager/][here]].

Suppose you are organizing some event, and you have a mailing list of email addresses and people you need to send a mail to telling them what room they will be in. You would like to send a personalized email to each person, and you do not want to type each one by hand. Python can automate this for you. All you need is the mailing list in some kind of structured format, and then you can go through it line by line to create and send emails.

We will use an org-table to store the data in.

#+tblname: mail-list
| First name | Last name | email address        | Room number |
|------------+-----------+----------------------+-------------|
| Jane       | Doe       | jane-doe@gmail.com   |           1 |
| John       | Doe       | john-doe@gmail.com   |           2 |
| Jimmy      | John      | jimmy-john@gmail.com |           3 |

We pass that table into an org-mode source block as a variable called data, which will be a list of lists, one for each row of the table. You could alternatively read these from an excel spreadsheet, a csv file, or some kind of python data structure.

We do not actually send the emails in this example. To do that you need to have access to a mail server, which could be on your own machine, or it could be a relay server you have access to.

We create a string that is a template with some fields to be substituted, e.g. the firstname and room number in this case. Then we loop through each row of the table, and format the template with those values, and create an email message to the person. First we print each message to check that they are correct.

#+BEGIN_SRC python :var data=mail-list :exports code
import smtplib
from email.mime.multipart import MIMEMultipart
from email.mime.text import MIMEText
from email.utils import  formatdate

template = '''

    msg['From'] = "youremail@gmail.com"
    msg['To'] = emailaddress

Raman spectroscopy is a vibrational spectroscopy. The data typically comes as intensity vs. wavenumber, and it is discrete. Sometimes it is necessary to identify the precise location of a peak. In this post, we will use spline smoothing to construct an interpolating function of the data, and then use fminbnd to identify peak positions.

This example was originally worked out in Matlab at http://matlab.cheme.cmu.edu/2012/08/27/peak-finding-in-raman-spectroscopy/

numpy:loadtxt

Let us take a look at the raw data.

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

w, i = np.loadtxt('data/raman.txt', usecols=(0, 1), unpack=True)

plt.plot(w, i)
plt.xlabel('Raman shift (cm$^{-1}$)')
plt.ylabel('Intensity (counts)')
plt.savefig('images/raman-1.png')
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:

: <matplotlib.text.Text object at 0x10b184ac8>
: <matplotlib.text.Text object at 0x108f8f9b0>

[[./images/raman-1.png]]

The next thing to do is narrow our focus to the region we are interested in between 1340 cm^{-1} and 1360 cm^{-1}.

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session
ind = (w > 1340) & (w < 1360)
w1 = w[ind]
i1 = i[ind]

plt.figure()
plt.plot(w1, i1, 'b. ')
plt.xlabel('Raman shift (cm$^{-1}$)')
plt.ylabel('Intensity (counts)')
plt.savefig('images/raman-2.png')
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:

: <matplotlib.text.Text object at 0x10f8f0ef0>
: <matplotlib.text.Text object at 0x10f8d5dd8>

[[./images/raman-2.png]]

Next we consider a scipy:UnivariateSpline. This function "smooths" the data.

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session
from scipy.interpolate import UnivariateSpline

# s is a "smoothing" factor
sp = UnivariateSpline(w1, i1, k=4, s=2000)

plt.plot(w1, i1, 'b. ')
plt.plot(w1, sp(w1), 'r-')
plt.xlabel('Raman shift (cm$^{-1}$)')
plt.ylabel('Intensity (counts)')
plt.savefig('images/raman-3.png')
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:

: <matplotlib.text.Text object at 0x10f8d5dd8>

[[./images/raman-3.png]]

Note that the UnivariateSpline function returns a "callable" function! Our next goal is to find the places where there are peaks. This is defined by the first derivative of the data being equal to zero. It is easy to get the first derivative of a UnivariateSpline with a second argument as shown below.

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session
# get the first derivative evaluated at all the points
d1s = sp.derivative()

d1 = d1s(w1)

# we can get the roots directly here, which correspond to minima and
# maxima.
print('Roots = {}'.format(sp.derivative().roots()))
minmax = sp.derivative().roots()

plt.clf()
plt.plot(w1, d1, label='first derivative')
plt.xlabel('Raman shift (cm$^{-1}$)')
plt.ylabel('First derivative')
plt.grid()

plt.figure()
plt.plot(minmax, d1s(minmax), 'ro ', label='zeros')
plt.legend(loc='best')

plt.plot(w1, i1, 'b. ')
plt.plot(w1, sp(w1), 'r-')
plt.xlabel('Raman shift (cm$^{-1}$)')
plt.ylabel('Intensity (counts)')
plt.plot(minmax, sp(minmax), 'ro ')

plt.savefig('images/raman-4.png')

In the end, we have illustrated how to construct a spline smoothing interpolation function and to find maxima in the function, including generating some initial guesses. There is more art to this than you might like, since you have to judge how much smoothing is enough or too much. With too much, you may smooth peaks out. With too little, noise may be mistaken for peaks.

*** Summary notes
Using org-mode with :session allows a large script to be broken up into mini sections. However, it only seems to work with the default python mode in Emacs, and it does not work with emacs-for-python or the latest python-mode. I also do not really like the output style, e.g. the output from the plotting commands.

** Curve fitting to get overlapping peak areas
  :PROPERTIES:

  :updated:  2013/02/27 14:45:44
  :END:

Today we examine an approach to fitting curves to overlapping peaks to deconvolute them so we can estimate the area under each curve. We have a text file that contains data from a gas chromatograph with two peaks that overlap. We want the area under each peak to estimate the gas composition. You will see how to read the text file in, parse it to get the data for plotting and analysis, and then how to fit it.


A line like "# of Points	9969" tells us the number of points we have to read. The data starts after a line containing "R.Time	Intensity". Here we read the number of points, and then get the data into arrays.

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

datafile = 'data/gc-data-21.txt'

i = 0
with open(datafile) as f:
    lines = f.readlines()

for i,line in enumerate(lines):
    if '# of Points' in line:
	npoints = int(line.split()[-1])
    elif 'R.Time\tIntensity' in line:
	i += 1
	break

# now get the data
t, intensity = [], []
for j in range(i, i + npoints):
    fields = lines[j].split()
    t += [float(fields[0])]
    intensity += [int(fields[1])]

t = np.array(t)
intensity = np.array(intensity, np.float)

# now plot the data in the relevant time frame
plt.plot(t, intensity)
plt.xlim([4, 6])
plt.xlabel('Time (s)')
plt.ylabel('Intensity (arb. units)')
plt.savefig('images/deconvolute-1.png')

You can see there is a non-zero baseline. We will normalize that by the average between 4 and 4.4 seconds.

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session
intensity -= np.mean(intensity[(t > 4.0) & (t < 4.4)])
plt.figure()
plt.plot(t, intensity)
plt.xlim([4, 6])
plt.xlabel('Time (s)')
plt.ylabel('Intensity (arb. units)')
plt.savefig('./images/deconvolute-2.png')

[[./images/deconvolute-2.png]]

The peaks are asymmetric, decaying gaussian functions. We define a function for this

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session
from scipy.special import erf

def asym_peak(t, pars):
    'from Anal. Chem. 1994, 66, 1294-1301'
    a0 = pars[0]  # peak area
    a1 = pars[1]  # elution time
    a2 = pars[2]  # width of gaussian
    a3 = pars[3]  # exponential damping term
    f = (a0/2/a3*np.exp(a2**2/2.0/a3**2 + (a1 - t)/a3)
	 *(erf((t-a1)/(np.sqrt(2.0)*a2) - a2/np.sqrt(2.0)/a3) + 1.0))
    return f
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:

To get two peaks, we simply add two peaks together.

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session
def two_peaks(t, *pars):
    'function of two overlapping peaks'
    a10 = pars[0]  # peak area
    a11 = pars[1]  # elution time
    a12 = pars[2]  # width of gaussian
    a13 = pars[3]  # exponential damping term
    a20 = pars[4]  # peak area
    a21 = pars[5]  # elution time
    a22 = pars[6]  # width of gaussian
    a23 = pars[7]  # exponential damping term
    p1 = asym_peak(t, [a10, a11, a12, a13])
    p2 = asym_peak(t, [a20, a21, a22, a23])
    return p1 + p2
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:

To show the function is close to reasonable, we plot the fitting function with an initial guess for each parameter. The fit is not good, but we have only guessed the parameters for now.


#+BEGIN_SRC python :session
parguess = (1500, 4.85, 0.05, 0.05, 5000, 5.1, 0.05, 0.1)
plt.figure()

plt.plot(t,two_peaks(t, *parguess),'g-')

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session
from scipy.optimize import curve_fit

popt, pcov = curve_fit(two_peaks, t, intensity, parguess)
print(popt)

plt.plot(t, two_peaks(t, *popt), 'r-')

The fits are not perfect. The small peak is pretty good, but there is an unphysical tail on the larger peak, and a small mismatch at the peak. There is not much to do about that, it means the model peak we are using is not a good model for the peak. We will still integrate the areas though.

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session
pars1 = popt[0:4]
pars2 = popt[4:8]

peak1 = asym_peak(t, pars1)
peak2 = asym_peak(t, pars2)

area1 = np.trapz(peak1, t)
area2 = np.trapz(peak2, t)

print('Area 1 = {0:1.2f}'.format(area1))
print('Area 2 = {0:1.2f}'.format(area2))

print('Area 1 is {0:1.2%} of the whole area'.format(area1/(area1 + area2)))
print('Area 2 is {0:1.2%} of the whole area'.format(area2/(area1 + area2)))

plt.figure()
plt.plot(t, intensity)
plt.plot(t, peak1, 'r-')
plt.plot(t, peak2, 'g-')

This sample was air, and the first peak is oxygen, and the second peak is nitrogen. we come pretty close to the actual composition of air, although it is low on the oxygen content. To do better, one would have to use a calibration curve.

In the end, the overlap of the peaks is pretty small, but it is still difficult to reliably and reproducibly deconvolute them. By using an algorithm like we have demonstrated here, it is possible at least to make the deconvolution reproducible.

*** Notable differences from Matlab
1. The order of arguments to np.trapz is reversed.
2. The order of arguments to the fitting function scipy.optimize.curve_fit is different than in Matlab.
3. The scipy.optimize.curve_fit function expects a fitting function that has all parameters as arguments, where Matlab expects a vector of parameters.

I got distracted looking for Shomate parameters for ethane today, and came across this [[http://senese.wordpress.com/2010/01/26/notebook-3-2-predicting-boiling-points-from-liquidvapor-gibbs-free-energy-functions/][website]] on predicting the boiling point of water using the Shomate equations.

The answer we get us 0.05 K too high, which is not bad considering we estimated it using parameters that were fitted to thermodynamic data and that had finite precision and extrapolated the steam properties below the region the parameters were stated to be valid for.

In Post 1536 we used the NIST webbook to compute a temperature dependent Gibbs energy of reaction, and then used a reaction extent variable to compute the equilibrium concentrations of each species for the water gas shift reaction.

Today, we look at the direct minimization of the Gibbs free energy of the species, with no assumptions about stoichiometry of reactions. We only apply the constraint of conservation of atoms. We use the NIST Webbook to provide the data for the Gibbs energy of each species.

As a reminder we consider equilibrium between the species $CO$, $H_2O$, $CO_2$ and $H_2$, at 1000K, and 10 atm total pressure with an initial equimolar molar flow rate of $CO$ and $H_2O$.

I found it necessary to tighten the accuracy parameter to get pretty good matches to the solutions found in Matlab. It was also necessary to increase the number of iterations. Even still, not all of the numbers match well, especially the very small numbers. You can, however, see that the constraints were satisfied pretty well.


Interestingly there is a distribution of products! That is interesting because only steam and ethane enter the reactor, but a small fraction of methane is formed! The main product is hydrogen. The stoichiometry of steam reforming is ideally $C_2H_6 + 4H_2O \rightarrow 2CO_2 + 7 H2$. Even though nearly all the ethane is consumed, we do not get the full yield of hydrogen. It appears that another equilibrium, one between CO, CO2, H2O and H2, may be limiting that, since the rest of the hydrogen is largely in the water. It is also of great importance that we have not said anything about reactions, i.e. how these products were formed.

The water gas shift reaction is: $CO + H_2O \rightleftharpoons CO_2 + H_2$. We can compute the Gibbs free energy of the reaction from the heats of formation of each species. Assuming these are the formation energies at 1000K, this is the reaction free energy at 1000K.

One normally uses activities to define the equilibrium constant. Since there are the same number of moles on each side of the reaction all factors that convert mole numbers to activity, concentration or pressure cancel, so we simply consider the ratio of mole numbers here.

This is very close to the equilibrium constant computed above.

Clearly, there is an equilibrium between these species that prevents the complete reaction of steam reforming.

*** Summary

This is an appealing way to minimize the Gibbs energy of a mixture. No assumptions about reactions are necessary, and the constraints are easy to identify. The Gibbs energy function is especially easy to code.

[[http://matlab.cheme.cmu.edu/2011/12/20/the-gibbs-free-energy-of-a-reacting-mixture-and-the-equilibrium-composition/][Matlab post]]

In this post we derive the equations needed to find the equilibrium composition of a reacting mixture. We use the method of direct minimization of the Gibbs free energy of the reacting mixture.

The Gibbs free energy of a mixture is defined as $G = \sum\limits_j \mu_j n_j$ where $\mu_j$ is the chemical potential of species $j$, and it is temperature and pressure dependent, and $n_j$ is the number of moles of species $j$.

We define the chemical potential as $\mu_j = G_j^\circ + RT\ln a_j$, where $G_j^\circ$ is the Gibbs energy in a standard state, and $a_j$ is the activity of species $j$ if the pressure and temperature are not at standard state conditions.

If a reaction is occurring, then the number of moles of each species are related to each other through the reaction extent $\epsilon$ and stoichiometric coefficients: $n_j = n_{j0} + \nu_j \epsilon$. Note that the reaction extent has units of moles.

Combining these three equations and expanding the terms leads to:

$$G = \sum\limits_j n_{j0}G_j^\circ +\sum\limits_j \nu_j G_j^\circ \epsilon +RT\sum\limits_j(n_{j0} + \nu_j\epsilon)\ln a_j $$

The first term is simply the initial Gibbs free energy that is present before any reaction begins, and it is a constant. It is difficult to evaluate, so we will move it to the left side of the equation in the next step, because it does not matter what its value is since it is a constant. The second term is related to the Gibbs free energy of reaction: $\Delta_rG = \sum\limits_j \nu_j G_j^\circ$. With these observations we rewrite the equation as:

$$G - \sum\limits_j n_{j0}G_j^\circ = \Delta_rG \epsilon +RT\sum\limits_j(n_{j0} + \nu_j\epsilon)\ln a_j $$

Now, we have an equation that allows us to compute the change in Gibbs free energy as a function of the reaction extent, initial number of moles of each species, and the activities of each species. This difference in Gibbs free energy has no natural scale, and depends on the size of the system, i.e. on $n_{j0}$. It is desirable to avoid this, so we now rescale the equation by the total initial moles present, $n_{T0}$ and define a new variable $\epsilon' = \epsilon/n_{T0}$, which is dimensionless. This leads to:

$$ \frac{G - \sum\limits_j n_{j0}G_j^\circ}{n_{T0}} = \Delta_rG \epsilon' + RT \sum\limits_j(y_{j0} + \nu_j\epsilon')\ln a_j $$

where $y_{j0}$ is the initial mole fraction of species $j$ present. The mole fractions are intensive properties that do not depend on the system size. Finally, we need to address $a_j$. For an ideal gas, we know that $A_j = \frac{y_j P}{P^\circ}$, where the numerator is the partial pressure of species $j$ computed from the mole fraction of species $j$ times the total pressure. To get the mole fraction we note:

$$y_j = \frac{n_j}{n_T} = \frac{n_{j0} + \nu_j \epsilon}{n_{T0} + \epsilon \sum\limits_j \nu_j} = \frac{y_{j0} + \nu_j \epsilon'}{1 + \epsilon'\sum\limits_j \nu_j} $$

This finally leads us to an equation that we can evaluate as a function of reaction extent:

$$ \frac{G - \sum\limits_j n_{j0}G_j^\circ}{n_{T0}} = \widetilde{\widetilde{G}} = \Delta_rG \epsilon' + RT\sum\limits_j(y_{j0} + \nu_j\epsilon') \ln\left(\frac{y_{j0}+\nu_j\epsilon'}{1+\epsilon'\sum\limits_j\nu_j} \frac{P}{P^\circ}\right) $$

we use a double tilde notation to distinguish this quantity from the quantity derived by Rawlings and Ekerdt which is further normalized by a factor of $RT$. This additional scaling makes the quantities dimensionless, and makes the quantity have a magnitude of order unity, but otherwise has no effect on the shape of the graph.

Finally, if we know the initial mole fractions, the initial total pressure, the Gibbs energy of reaction, and the stoichiometric coefficients, we can plot the scaled reacting mixture energy as a function of reaction extent. At equilibrium, this energy will be a minimum. We consider the example in Rawlings and Ekerdt where isobutane (I) reacts with 1-butene (B) to form 2,2,3-trimethylpentane (P). The reaction occurs at a total pressure of 2.5 atm at 400K, with equal molar amounts of I and B. The standard Gibbs free energy of reaction at 400K is -3.72 kcal/mol.

The [[http://webbook.nist.gov/chemistry/][NIST webbook]] provides parameterized models of the enthalpy, entropy and heat capacity of many molecules. In this example, we will examine how to use these to compute the equilibrium constant for the water gas shift reaction $CO + H_2O \rightleftharpoons CO_2 + H_2$ in the temperature range of 500K to 1000K.

Parameters are provided for:

   Cp = heat capacity (J/mol*K)
   H = standard enthalpy (kJ/mol)
   S = standard entropy (J/mol*K)

with models in the form: $Cp^\circ = A + B*t + C*t^2 + D*t^3 + E/t^2$

$H^\circ - H^\circ_{298.15}= A*t + B*t^2/2 + C*t^3/3 + D*t^4/4 - E/t + F - H$

$S^\circ = A*ln(t) + B*t + C*t^2/2 + D*t^3/3 - E/(2*t^2) + G$

where $t=T/1000$, and $T$ is the temperature in Kelvin. We can use this data to calculate equilibrium constants in the following manner. First, we have heats of formation at standard state for each compound; for elements, these are zero by definition, and for non-elements, they have values available from the NIST webbook. There are also values for the absolute entropy at standard state. Then, we have an expression for the change in enthalpy from standard state as defined above, as well as the absolute entropy. From these we can derive the reaction enthalpy, free energy and entropy at standard state, as well as at other temperatures.

We will examine the water gas shift enthalpy, free energy and equilibrium constant from 500K to 1000K, and finally compute the equilibrium composition of a gas feed containing 5 atm of CO and H_2 at 1000K.

*** Non-standard state $\Delta H$ and $\Delta G$

We have to correct for temperature change away from standard state. We only correct the enthalpy for this temperature change. The correction looks like this:

$$ \Delta H_{rxn}(T) = \Delta H_{rxn}(T_{ref}) + \sum_i \nu_i (H_i(T)-H_i(T_{ref}))$$

Where $\nu_i$ are the stoichiometric coefficients of each species, with appropriate sign for reactants and products, and $(H_i(T)-H_i(T_{ref})$ is precisely what is calculated for each species with the equations

The entropy is on an absolute scale, so we directly calculate entropy at each temperature. Recall that H is in kJ/mol and S is in J/mol/K, so we divide S by 1000 to make the units match.

Over this temperature range the reaction is exothermic, although near 1000K it is just barely exothermic. At higher temperatures we expect the reaction to become endothermic.

*** Equilibrium yield of WGS

Now let us suppose we have a reactor with a feed of H_2O and CO at 10atm at 1000K. What is the equilibrium yield of H_2? Let $\epsilon$ be the extent of reaction, so that $F_i = F_{i,0} + \nu_i \epsilon$. For reactants, $\nu_i$ is negative, and for products, $\nu_i$ is positive. We have to solve for the extent of reaction that satisfies the equilibrium condition.

*** Compute gas phase pressures of each species

Since there is no change in moles for this reaction, we can directly calculation the pressures from the equilibrium conversion and the initial pressure of gases. you can see there is a slightly higher pressure of H_2 and CO_2 than the reactants, consistent with the equilibrium constant of about 1.44 at 1000K. At a lower temperature there would be a much higher yield of the products. For example, at 550K the equilibrium constant is about 58, and the pressure of H_2 is 4.4 atm due to a much higher equilibrium conversion of 0.88.

*** Summary

The NIST Webbook provides a plethora of data for computing thermodynamic properties. It is a little tedious to enter it all into Matlab, and a little tricky to use the data to estimate temperature dependent reaction energies. A limitation of the Webbook is that it does not tell you have the thermodynamic properties change with pressure. Luckily, those changes tend to be small.

I noticed a different behavior in interpolation between scipy.interpolate.interp1d and Matlab's interp1. The scipy function returns an interpolating function, whereas the Matlab function directly interpolates new values, and returns the actual interpolated data.

The equilibrium composition of a reaction is the one that minimizes the total Gibbs free energy. The Gibbs free energy of a reacting ideal gas mixture depends on the mole fractions of each species, which are determined by the initial mole fractions of each species, the extent of reactions that convert each species, and the equilibrium constants.

Reaction 1: $I + B \rightleftharpoons P1$

Reaction 2: $I + B \rightleftharpoons P2$

Here we define the Gibbs free energy of the mixture as a function of the reaction extents.

#+RESULTS:

The equilibrium constants for these reactions are known, and we seek to find the equilibrium reaction extents so we can determine equilibrium compositions. The equilibrium reaction extents are those that minimize the Gibbs free energy.  We have the following constraints, written in standard less than or equal to form:

$-\epsilon_1 \le 0$

$-\epsilon_2 \le 0$

$\epsilon_1 + \epsilon_2 \le 0.5$

In Matlab we express this in matrix form as Ax=b where
\begin{equation}
A = \left[ \begin{array}{cc} -1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \\ 1 & 1 \end{array} \right]
\end{equation}

and

\begin{equation}
b = \left[ \begin{array}{c} 0 \\ 0 \\ 0.5\end{array} \right]
\end{equation}

Unlike in Matlab, in python we construct the inequality constraints as functions that are greater than or equal to zero when the constraint is met.

One way we can verify our solution is to plot the gibbs function and see where the minimum is, and whether there is more than one minimum. We start by making grids over the range of 0 to 0.5. Note we actually start slightly above zero because at zero there are some numerical imaginary elements of the gibbs function or it is numerically not defined since there are logs of zero there. We also set all elements where the sum of the two extents is greater than 0.5 to near zero, since those regions violate the constraints.

The problem we solve here is that we have several compounds containing Ni and Al, and a bulk mixture of a particular composition of Ni and Al. We want to know which mixture of phases will minimize the total energy. The tricky part is that the optimization is constrained because the mixture of phases must have the overall stoichiometry we want.  We formulate the problem like this.

Basically, we want to minimize the function $E = \sum w_i E_i$, where $w_i$ is the mass of phase $i$, and $E_i$ is the energy per unit mass of phase $i$. There are some constraints to ensure conservation of mass. Let us consider the following compounds: Al, NiAl, Ni3Al, and Ni, and consider a case where the bulk composition of our alloy is 93.8% Ni and balance Al. We want to know which phases are present, and in what proportions. There are some subtleties in considering the formula and molecular weight of an alloy. We consider the formula with each species amount normalized so the fractions all add up to one. For example, Ni_3Al is represented as Ni_{0.75}Al_{0.25}, and the molecular weight is computed as 0.75*MW_{Ni} + 0.25*MW_{Al}.

We use scipy.optimize.fmin_slsqp to solve this problem, and define two equality constraint functions, and the bounds on each weight fraction.

Note: the energies in this example were computed by density functional theory at 0K.

This means we have a 1:1 molar ratio of Ni and Ni_{0.75}Al_{0.25}. That works out to the overall bulk composition in this particular problem.

Let us verify that these two approaches really lead to the same conclusions. On a weight basis we estimate 53.3%wt Ni and 46.7%wt Ni3Al, whereas we predict an equimolar mixture of the two phases. Below we compute the mole fraction of Ni in each case.

Atoms cannot be destroyed in non-nuclear chemical reactions, hence it follows that the same number of atoms entering a reactor must also leave the reactor. The atoms may leave the reactor in a different molecular configuration due to the reaction, but the total mass leaving the reactor must be the same. Here we look at a few ways to show this.

We consider the water gas shift reaction : $CO + H_2O \rightleftharpoons H_2 + CO_2$. We can illustrate the conservation of mass with the following equation: $\bf{\nu}\bf{M}=\bf{0}$. Where $\bf{\nu}$ is the stoichiometric coefficient vector and $\bf{M}$ is a column vector of molecular weights. For simplicity, we use pure isotope molecular weights, and not the isotope-weighted molecular weights. This equation simply examines the mass on the right side of the equation and the mass on left side of the equation.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
import numpy as np
nu = [-1, -1, 1, 1];
M = [28, 18, 2, 44];
print(np.dot(nu, M))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: 0

You can see that sum of the stoichiometric coefficients times molecular weights is zero. In other words a CO and H_2O have the same mass as H_2 and CO_2.

For any balanced chemical equation, there are the same number of each kind of atom on each side of the equation. Since the mass of each atom is unchanged with reaction, that means the mass of all the species that are reactants must equal the mass of all the species that are products! Here we look at the number of C, O, and H on each side of the reaction. Now if we add the mass of atoms in the reactants and products, it should sum to zero (since we used the negative sign for stoichiometric coefficients of reactants).

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session
import numpy as np
	    # C   O   H
reactants = [-1, -2, -2]
products  = [ 1,  2,  2]

print(np.dot(reactants, atomic_masses) + np.dot(products, atomic_masses))

#+RESULTS:

That is all there is to mass conservation with reactions. Nothing changes if there are lots of reactions, as long as each reaction is properly balanced, and none of them are nuclear reactions!

If reaction rates are fast compared to diffusion in a porous catalyst pellet, then the observed kinetics will appear to be slower than they really are because not all of the catalyst surface area will be effectively used. For example, the reactants may all be consumed in the near surface area of a catalyst bead, and the inside of the bead will be unutilized because no reactants can get in due to the high reaction rates.

A mole balance on the particle volume in spherical coordinates with a first order reaction leads to: $\frac{d^2Ca}{dr^2} + \frac{2}{r}\frac{dCa}{dr}-\frac{k}{D_e}C_A=0$ with boundary conditions $C_A(R) = C_{As}$ and $\frac{dCa}{dr}=0$ at $r=0$. We convert this equation to a system of first order ODEs by letting $W_A=\frac{dCa}{dr}$. Then, our two equations become:

\(\frac{dCa}{dr} = W_A\)

and

\(\frac{dW_A}{dr} = -\frac{2}{r} W_A + \frac{k}{D_E} C_A\)

We have a condition of no flux ($W_A=0$) at r=0 and Ca(R) = CAs, which makes this a boundary value problem. We use the shooting method here, and guess what Ca(0) is and iterate the guess to get Ca(R) = CAs.

The value of the second differential equation at r=0 is tricky because at this place we have a 0/0 term. We use L'Hopital's rule to evaluate it. The derivative of the top is $\frac{dW_A}{dr}$ and the derivative of the bottom is 1. So, we have
\(\frac{dW_A}{dr} = -2\frac{dW_A}{dr} + \frac{k}{D_E} C_A\)

Which leads to:

\(3 \frac{dW_A}{dr} =  \frac{k}{D_E} C_A\)

or \(\frac{dW_A}{dr} =  \frac{3k}{D_E} C_A\) at $r=0$.

Finally, we implement the equations in Python and solve.

You can see the concentration of A inside the particle is significantly lower than outside the particle. That is because it is reacting away faster than it can diffuse into the particle. Hence, the overall reaction rate in the particle is lower than it would be without the diffusion limit.

The effectiveness factor is the ratio of the actual reaction rate in the particle with diffusion limitation to the ideal rate in the particle if there was no concentration gradient:

$$\eta = \frac{\int_0^R k'' a C_A(r) 4 \pi r^2 dr}{\int_0^R k'' a C_{As} 4 \pi r^2 dr}$$

We will evaluate this numerically from our solution and compare it to the analytical solution. The results are in good agreement, and you can make the numerical estimate better by increasing the number of points in the solution so that the numerical integration is more accurate.

Why go through the numerical solution when an analytical solution exists? The analytical solution here is only good for 1st order kinetics in a sphere. What would you do for a complicated rate law? You might be able to find some limiting conditions where the analytical equation above is relevant, and if you are lucky, they are appropriate for your problem. If not, it is a good thing you can figure this out numerically!

A heat exchanger must handle 2.5 L/s of water through a smooth pipe with length of 100 m. The pressure drop cannot exceed 103 kPa at 25 degC. Compute the minimum pipe diameter required for this application.

Adapted from problem 8.8 in Problem solving in chemical and Biochemical Engineering with Polymath, Excel, and Matlab. page 303.

We need to estimate the Fanning friction factor for these conditions so we can estimate the frictional losses that result in a pressure drop for a uniform, circular pipe. The frictional forces are given by $F_f = 2f_F \frac{\Delta L v^2}{D}$, and the corresponding pressure drop is given by $\Delta P = \rho F_f$. In these equations, $\rho$ is the fluid density, $v$ is the fluid velocity, $D$ is the pipe diameter, and $f_F$ is the Fanning friction factor. The average fluid velocity is given by $v = \frac{q}{\pi D^2/4}$.

For laminar flow, we estimate $f_F = 16/Re$, which is a linear equation, and for turbulent flow ($Re > 2100$) we have the implicit equation $\frac{1}{\sqrt{f_F}}=4.0 \log(Re \sqrt{f_F})-0.4$. Of course, we define $Re = \frac{D v\rho}{\mu}$ where $\mu$ is the viscosity of the fluid.

It is known that $\rho(T) = 46.048 + 9.418 T -0.0329 T^2 +4.882\times10^{-5}-2.895\times10^{-8}T^4$ and $\mu = \exp\left({-10.547 + \frac{541.69}{T-144.53}}\right)$ where $\rho$ is in kg/m^3 and $\mu$ is in kg/(m*s).

The aim is to find $D$ that solves: $\Delta p = \rho 2 f_F \frac{\Delta L v^2}{D}$. This is a nonlinear equation in $D$, since D affects the fluid velocity, the Re, and the Fanning friction factor. Here is the solution

To use this data, you find the line that has the compound you want, and read off the data. You could do that manually for each component you want but that is tedious, and error prone. Today we will see how to retrieve the file, then read the data into python to create a database we can use to store and retrieve the data.

We will use the data to find the temperature at which the vapor pressure of acetone is 400 mmHg.

We previously learned to read a datafile containing lots of Antoine coefficients into a database, and use the coefficients to estimate vapor pressure of a single compound. Here we use those coefficents to compute a bubble point pressure of a mixture.

The bubble point is the temperature at which the sum of the component vapor pressures is equal to the the total pressure. This is where a bubble of vapor will first start forming, and the mixture starts to boil.

Consider an equimolar mixture of benzene, toluene, chloroform, acetone and methanol. Compute the bubble point at 760 mmHg, and the gas phase composition. The gas phase composition is given by: $y_i = x_i*P_i/P_T$.

When a gas is below its Tc the van der Waal equation oscillates. In the portion of the isotherm where $\partial P_R/\partial V_r > 0$, the isotherm fails to describe real materials, which phase separate into a liquid and gas in this region.

Maxwell proposed to replace this region by a flat line, where the area above and below the curves are equal. Today, we examine how to identify where that line should be.

To find the areas, we need to know where the intersection of the vdW eqn with the horizontal line. This is the same as asking what are the roots of the vdW equation at that Pr. We need all three intersections so we can integrate from the first root to the middle root, and then the middle root to the third root. We take advantage of the polynomial nature of the vdW equation, which allows us to use the roots command to get all the roots at once. The polynomial is $V_R^3 - \frac{1}{3}(1+8 T_R/P_R) + 3/P_R - 1/P_R = 0$. We use the coefficients t0 get the roots like this.

Given this reaction $A \rightleftharpoons B$, with these rate laws:

forward rate law: $-r_a = k_1 C_A$

backward rate law: $-r_b = k_{-1} C_B$

plot the concentration of A vs. time. This example illustrates a set of coupled first order ODES.

A common problem to solve in reaction engineering is finding the equilibrium conversion.[fn:fogler-setup] A typical problem to solve is the following nonlinear equation:

$1.44 = \frac{X_e^2}{(1-X_e)^2}$

To solve this we create a function:

$f(X_e)=0=1.44 - \frac{X_e^2}{(1-X_e)^2}$

and use a nonlinear solver to find the value of $X_e$ that makes this function equal to zero. We have to provide an initial guess. Chemical intuition suggests that the solution must be between 0 and 1, and mathematical intuition suggests the solution might be near 0.5 (which would give a ratio near 1).

Here is our solution.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
from scipy.optimize import fsolve

def func(Xe):
    z = 1.44 - (Xe**2)/(1-Xe)**2
    return z

X0 = 0.5
Xe, = fsolve(func, X0)
print('The equilibrium conversion is X = {0:1.2f}'.format(Xe))
#+END_SRC

For a constant volume batch reactor where $A \rightarrow B$ at a rate of $-r_A = k C_A^2$, we derive the following design equation for the length of time required to achieve a particular level of conversion :

$t(X) = \frac{1}{k C_{A0}} \int_{X=0}^X \frac{dX}{(1-X)^2}$

if $k = 10^{-3}$ L/mol/s and $C_{A0}$ = 1 mol/L, estimate the time to achieve 90% conversion.

We could analytically solve the integral and evaluate it, but instead we will numerically evaluate it using scipy.integrate.quad. This function returns two values: the evaluated integral, and an estimate of the absolute error in the answer.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
from scipy.integrate import quad

def integrand(X):
    k = 1.0e-3
    Ca0 = 1.0  # mol/L
    return 1./(k*Ca0)*(1./(1-X)**2)

sol, abserr = quad(integrand, 0, 0.9)
print('t = {0} seconds ({1} hours)'.format(sol, sol/3600))
print('Estimated absolute error = {0}'.format(abserr))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: t = 9000.000000000007 seconds (2.500000000000002 hours)

You can see the estimate error is very small compared to the solution.

In a [[http://jkitchin.github.io/blog/2013/01/06/Integrating-a-batch-reactor-design-equation/][previous example]], we solved for the time to reach a specific conversion in a batch reactor. However, it is likely there is uncertainty in the rate constant, and possibly in the initial concentration. Here we examine the effects of that uncertainty on the time to reach the desired conversion.

To do this we have to write a function that takes arguments with uncertainty, and wrap the function with the uncertainties.wrap decorator. The function must return a single float number (current limitation of the uncertainties package). Then, we simply call the function, and the uncertainties from the inputs will be automatically propagated to the outputs. Let us say there is about 10% uncertainty in the rate constant, and 1% uncertainty in the initial concentration.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
from scipy.integrate import quad
import uncertainties as u

k = u.ufloat((1.0e-3, 1.0e-4))
Ca0 = u.ufloat((1.0, 0.01))# mol/L

@u.wrap
def func(k, Ca0):
    def integrand(X):
	return 1./(k*Ca0)*(1./(1-X)**2)
    integral, abserr = quad(integrand, 0, 0.9)
    return integral

sol = func(k, Ca0)
print('t = {0} seconds ({1} hours)'.format(sol, sol/3600))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: t = (9.0+/-0.9)e+03 seconds (2.50+/-0.25 hours)

The result shows about a 10% uncertainty in the time, which is similar to the largest uncertainty in the inputs.  This information should certainly be used in making decisions about how long to actually run the reactor to be sure of reaching the goal. For example, in this case, running the reactor for 3 hours (that is roughly + 2\sigma) would ensure at a high level of confidence (approximately 95% confidence) that you reach at least 90% conversion.

An alternative approach of evaluating an integral is to integrate a differential equation. For the batch reactor, the differential equation that describes conversion as a function of time is:

$\frac{dX}{dt} = -r_A V/N_{A0}$.

Given a value of initial concentration, or volume and initial number of moles of A, we can integrate this ODE to find the conversion at some later time. We assume that $X(t=0)=0$. We will integrate the ODE over a time span of 0 to 10,000 seconds.

Given a continuously stirred tank reactor with a volume of 66,000 dm^3 where the reaction $A \rightarrow B$ occurs, at a rate of $-r_A = k C_A^2$ ($k=3$ L/mol/h), with an entering molar flow of F_{A0} = 5 mol/h and a volumetric flowrate of 10 L/h, what is the exit concentration of A?

From a mole balance we know that at steady state $0 = F_{A0} - F_A + V r_A$. That equation simply states the sum of the molar flow of A in in minus the molar flow of A out  plus the molar rate A is generated is equal to zero at steady state. This is directly the equation we need to solve. We need the following relationship:

1. $F_A = v0 C_A$

#+BEGIN_SRC python :exports both
from scipy.optimize import fsolve

Fa0 = 5.0
v0 = 10.

V = 66000.0  # reactor volume L^3
k = 3.0      # rate constant L/mol/h

def func(Ca):
    "Mole balance for a CSTR. Solve this equation for func(Ca)=0"
    Fa = v0 * Ca     # exit molar flow of A
    ra = -k * Ca**2  # rate of reaction of A L/mol/h
    return Fa0 - Fa + V * ra

# CA guess that that 90 % is reacted away

It is a little confusing why it is necessary to put a comma after the CA_sol in the fsolve command. If you do not put it there, you get brackets around the answer.

*** Summary

This was an interesting exercise. On one hand, the tedium of interpolating the steam tables is gone. On the other hand, you still have to know exactly what to ask for to get an answer that is correct. The iapws interface is a little clunky, and takes some getting used to. It does not seem as robust as the Xsteam module I used in Matlab.

Suppose we have a space that is divided by a boundary into two regions, and we want to know if an arbitrary point is on one region or the other. One way to figure this out is to pick a point that is known to be in a region, and then draw a line to the arbitrary point counting the number of times it crosses the boundary. If the line crosses an even number of times, then the point is in the same region and if it crosses an odd number of times, then the point is in the other region.

Here is the boundary and region we consider in this example:

In this example, the boundary is complicated, and not described by a simple function. We will check for intersections of the line from the arbitrary point to the reference point with each segment defining the boundary. If there is an intersection in the boundary, we count that as a crossing. We choose the origin (0, 0) in this case for the reference point. For an arbitrary point (x1, y1), the equation of the line is therefore (provided x1 !=0):

$y = \frac{y1}{x1} x$.

Let the points defining a boundary segment be (bx1, by1) and (bx2, by2). The equation for the line connecting these points (provided bx1 != bx2) is:

$y = by1 + \frac{by2 - by1}{bx2 - bx1}(x - bx1)$

Setting these two equations equal to each other, we can solve for the value of $x$, and if $bx1 <= x <= bx2$ then we would say there is an intersection with that segment. The solution for x is:

$x = \frac{m bx1 - by1}{m - y1/x1}$

This can only fail if $m = y1/x1$ which means the segments are parallel and either do not intersect or go through each other. One issue we have to resolve is what to do when the intersection is at the boundary. In that case, we would see an intersection with two segments since bx1 of one segment is also bx2 of another segment. We resolve the issue by only counting intersections with bx1. Finally, there may be intersections at values of $x$ greater than the point, and we are not interested in those because the intersections are not between the point and reference point.

Here are all of the special cases that we  have to handle:

[[./images/region-determination.png]]

We will have to do float comparisons, so we will define [[Is your ice cream float bigger than mine][tolerance functions]] for all of these. I tried this previously with regular comparison operators, and there were many cases that did not work because of float comparisons. In the code that follows, we define the tolerance functions, the function that handles almost all the special cases, and show that it almost always correctly identifies the region a point is in.

If you look carefully, there are two blue points in the red region, which means there is some edge case we do not capture in our function. Kudos to the person who figures it out.
Update: It was pointed out that the points intersect a point on the line.

[[http://matlab.cheme.cmu.edu/2011/08/05/using-cmu-units-in-matlab-for-basic-calculations/][Units in Matlab]]

I think an essential feature in an engineering computational environment is properly handling units and unit conversions. Mathcad supports that pretty well. I wrote a [[https://github.com/jkitchin/matlab-cmu][package]] for doing it in Matlab. Today I am going to explore units in python. Here are some of the packages that I have found which support units to some extent

1. http://pypi.python.org/pypi/units/
2. http://packages.python.org/quantities/user/tutorial.html
3. http://dirac.cnrs-orleans.fr/ScientificPython/ScientificPythonManual/Scientific.Physics.PhysicalQuantities-module.html
4. http://home.scarlet.be/be052320/Unum.html
5. https://simtk.org/home/python_units
6. http://docs.enthought.com/scimath/units/intro.html

The last one looks most promising.

q = np.array([1, 2, 3]) * mol
print(q)

print(P)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:

That doesn't look too bad. It is a little clunky to have to import every unit, and it is clear the package is saving everything in SI units by default. Let us try to solve an equation.

Find the time that solves this equation.

$0.01 = C_{A0} e^{-kt}$

First we solve without units. That way we know the answer.
#+BEGIN_SRC python
import numpy as np
from scipy.optimize import fsolve

CA0 = 1.0  # mol/L
CA = 0.01  # mol/L
k = 1.0    # 1/s

def func(t):
    z = CA - CA0 * np.exp(-k*t)
    return z

t0 = 2.3

t, = fsolve(func, t0)
print 't = {0:1.2f} seconds'.format(t)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: t = 4.61 seconds


Now, with units. I note here that I tried the obvious thing of just importing the units, and adding them on, but the package is unable to work with floats that have units. For some functions, there must be an ndarray with units which is practically what the UnitScalar code below does.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
import numpy as np
from scipy.optimize import fsolve
from scimath.units.volume import liter
from scimath.units.substance import mol
from scimath.units.time import second
from scimath.units.api import has_units, UnitScalar

CA0 = UnitScalar(1.0, units = mol / liter)
CA = UnitScalar(0.01, units = mol / liter)
k = UnitScalar(1.0, units = 1 / second)

@has_units(inputs="t::units=s",
	   outputs="result::units=mol/liter")
def func(t):
    z = CA - CA0 * float(np.exp(-k*t))
    return z

t0 = UnitScalar(2.3, units = second)

t, = fsolve(func, t0)
print 't = {0:1.2f} seconds'.format(t)
print type(t)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: t = 4.61 seconds
: <type 'numpy.float64'>

This is some heavy syntax that in the end does not preserve the units. In my Matlab package, we had to "wrap" many functions like fsolve so they would preserve units. Clearly this package will need that as well. Overall, in its current implementation this package does not do what I would expect all the time.[fn:units]

[fn:units] Then again no package does yet!

Our function works fine with units, but fsolve does not pass numbers with units back to the function, so this function fails because the exponential function gets an argument with dimensions in it.  We can create a new function that solves this problem. We need to "wrap" the function we want to solve to make sure that it uses units, but returns a float number. Then, we put the units back onto the final solved value. Here is how we do that.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
import quantities as u
import numpy as np

from scipy.optimize import fsolve as _fsolve

CA0 = 1 * u.mol / u.L
CA = 0.01 * u.mol / u.L
k = 1.0 / u.s

def func(t):
    return CA - CA0 * np.exp(-k * t)

def fsolve(func, t0):
    'wrapped fsolve command to work with units'
    tU = t0 / float(t0)  # units on initial guess, normalized
    def wrapped_func(t):
	't will be unitless, so we add unit to it. t * tU has units.'
	return float(func(t * tU))

    sol, = _fsolve(wrapped_func, t0)
    return sol * tU

tguess = 4 * u.s

print(fsolve(func, tguess))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:

It is a little tedious to do this, but we might only have to do it once if we store the new fsolve command in a module. You might notice the wrapped function we wrote above only works for one dimensional problems. If there are multiple dimensions, we have to be a little more careful. In the next example, we expand the wrapped function definition to do both one and multidimensional problems. It appears we cannot use numpy.array element-wise multiplication because you cannot mix units in an array. We will use lists instead. When the problem is one-dimensional, the function will take a scalar, but when it is multidimensional it will take a list or array. We will use try/except blocks to handle these two cases. We will assume multidimensional cases, and if that raises an exception because the argument is not a list, we assume it is scalar. Here is the more robust code example.

#+BEGIN_SRC python

    to the argument and return floats. Finally we call the original
    fsolve from scipy. Note: this does not support all of the options
    to fsolve.'''

    try:
	tU = [t / float(t) for t in t0]  # units on initial guess, normalized
    except TypeError:
	tU = t0 / float(t0)

    def wrapped_func(t):

That is pretty good. There is still room for improvement in the wrapped function, as it does not support all of the options that scipy.optimize.fsolve supports. Here is a draft of a function that does that. We have to return different numbers of arguments depending on the value of full_output. This function works, but I have not fully tested all the options. Here are three examples that work, including one with an argument.

: sol3 =  2.0 kg

The only downside I can see in the quantities module is that it only handle temperature differences, and not absolute temperatures. If you only use absolute temperatures, this would not be a problem I think. But, if you have mixed temperature scales, the quantities module does not convert them on an absolute scale.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
import quantities as u

T = 20 * u.degC

print(T.rescale(u.K))
print(T.rescale(u.degF))

Nevertheless, this module seems pretty promising, and there are a lot more features than shown here. Some documentation can be found at http://pythonhosted.org/quantities/.

That is not too bad. This is another example of a function you would want to save in a module for reuse. There is one bad feature of the wrapped odeint function, and that is that it changes the solution for coupled ODEs from an ndarray to a list. That is necessary because you apparently cannot have mixed units in an ndarray. It is fine, however, to have a list of mixed units. This is not a huge problem, but it changes the syntax for plotting results for the wrapped odeint function compared to the unwrapped function without units.

As we have seen, handling units with third party functions is fragile, and often requires additional code to wrap the function to handle the units. An alternative approach that avoids the wrapping is to rescale the equations so they are dimensionless. Then, we should be able to use all the standard external functions without modification. We obtain the final solutions by rescaling back to the answers we want.

Before doing the examples, let us consider how the quantities package handles dimensionless numbers.

As you can see, the dimensionless number is scaled properly, and is listed as dimensionless. The result is still an instance of a quantities object though. That is not likely to be a problem.

Now, we consider using fsolve with dimensionless equations. Our goal is to solve $C_A = C_{A0} \exp(-k t)$ for the time required to reach a desired $C_A$. We let $X = Ca / Ca0$ and $\tau = t * k$, which leads to $X = \exp{-\tau}$ in dimensionless terms.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
import quantities as u
import numpy as np
from scipy.optimize import fsolve

CA0 = 1 * u.mol / u.L
CA = 0.01 * u.mol / u.L  # desired exit concentration
k = 1.0 / u.s

# we need new dimensionless variables
# let X = Ca / Ca0
# so, Ca = Ca0 * X

# let tau = t * k
# so t = tau / k

X = CA / CA0 # desired exit dimensionless concentration

def func(tau):
    return X - np.exp(-tau)

tauguess = 2

print(func(tauguess)) # confirm we have a dimensionless function

tau_sol, = fsolve(func, tauguess)
t = tau_sol / k
print(t)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: -0.1253352832366127 dimensionless
: 4.605170185988091 s

Now consider the ODE $\frac{dCa}{dt} = -k Ca$. We let $X = Ca/Ca0$, so $Ca0 dX = dCa$. Let $\tau = t * k$ which in this case is dimensionless. That means $d\tau = k dt$. Substitution of these new variables leads to:

\(Ca0*k \frac{dX}{d\tau} = -k Ca0 X \)

or equivalently:
\(\frac{dX}{d\tau} = -X \)

#+BEGIN_SRC python
import quantities as u

k = 0.23 / u.s
Ca0 = 1 * u.mol / u.L

# Let X = Ca/Ca0  -> Ca = Ca0 * X  dCa = dX/Ca0
# let tau = t * k -> dt = 1/k dtau


def dXdtau(X, tau):
    return -X

import numpy as np
from scipy.integrate import odeint

tspan = np.linspace(0, 5) * u.s
tauspan = tspan * k

X0 = 1
X_sol = odeint(dXdtau, X0, tauspan)

print('Ca at t = {0} = {1}'.format(tspan[-1], X_sol.flatten()[-1] * Ca0))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: Ca at t = 5.0 s = 0.31663677735141815 mol/L

That is pretty much it. Using dimensionless quantities simplifies the need to write wrapper code, although it does increase the effort to rederive your equations (with corresponding increased opportunities to make mistakes). Using units to confirm your dimensionless derivation reduces those opportunities.

 Copyright (C) 2000, 2001, 2002, 2007, 2008 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     <http://fsf.org/>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

0. PREAMBLE

The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
functional and useful document "free" in the sense of freedom: to
assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
with or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially.
Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way
to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible
for modifications made by others.

This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.  It
complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
license designed for free software.

We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free
software, because free software needs free documentation: a free
program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the
software does.  But this License is not limited to software manuals;
it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or
whether it is published as a printed book.  We recommend this License
principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.


1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be
distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice grants a
world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that
work under the conditions stated herein.  The "Document", below,
refers to any such manual or work.  Any member of the public is a
licensee, and is addressed as "you".  You accept the license if you
copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission
under copyright law.

A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
modifications and/or translated into another language.

A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of
the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall
subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall
directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document is in
part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain
any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of historical
connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,
commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
them.

The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles
are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice
that says that the Document is released under this License.  If a
section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not
allowed to be designated as Invariant.  The Document may contain zero
Invariant Sections.  If the Document does not identify any Invariant
Sections then there are none.

The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are listed,
as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that
the Document is released under this License.  A Front-Cover Text may
be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.

A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
represented in a format whose specification is available to the
general public, that is suitable for revising the document
straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or
for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input
to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file
format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart
or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent.
An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount
of text.  A copy that is not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".

Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML
or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple
HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification.  Examples of
transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG.  Opaque formats
include proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by
proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or
processing tools are not generally available, and the
machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word
processors for output purposes only.

The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material
this License requires to appear in the title page.  For works in
formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title Page" means
the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title,
preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

The "publisher" means any person or entity that distributes copies of
the Document to the public.

A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document whose
title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following
text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ stands for a
specific section name mentioned below, such as "Acknowledgements",
"Dedications", "Endorsements", or "History".)  To "Preserve the Title"
of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a
section "Entitled XYZ" according to this definition.

The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which
states that this License applies to the Document.  These Warranty
Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this
License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has
no effect on the meaning of this License.

2. VERBATIM COPYING

You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies
to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no
other conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You may not use
technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further
copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However, you may accept
compensation in exchange for copies.  If you distribute a large enough
number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.

You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and
you may publicly display copies.


3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have
printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the
Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the
copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover
Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on
the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify
you as the publisher of these copies.  The front cover must present
the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and
visible.  You may add other material on the covers in addition.
Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve
the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated
as verbatim copying in other respects.

If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
pages.

If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering
more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent
copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy
a computer-network location from which the general network-using
public has access to download using public-standard network protocols
a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material.
If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps,
when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure
that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an
Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that
edition to the public.

It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to
give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the
Document.


4. MODIFICATIONS

You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under
the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release
the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified
Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution
and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy
of it.  In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:

A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct
   from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions
   (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section
   of the Document).  You may use the same title as a previous version
   if the original publisher of that version gives permission.
B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities
   responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified
   Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the
   Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five),
   unless they release you from this requirement.
C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
   Modified Version, as the publisher.
D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.
E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
   adjacent to the other copyright notices.
F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice
   giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the
   terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.
G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections
   and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.
H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.
I. Preserve the section Entitled "History", Preserve its Title, and add
   to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and
   publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page.  If
   there is no section Entitled "History" in the Document, create one
   stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as
   given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified
   Version as stated in the previous sentence.
J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for
   public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise
   the network locations given in the Document for previous versions
   it was based on.  These may be placed in the "History" section.
   You may omit a network location for a work that was published at
   least four years before the Document itself, or if the original
   publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.
K. For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",
   Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all
   the substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements
   and/or dedications given therein.
L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
   unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
   or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.
M. Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section
   may not be included in the Modified Version.
N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled "Endorsements"
   or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.
O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.

If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material
copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all
of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their titles to the
list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice.
These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.

You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a
standard.

You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list
of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage of
Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document already
includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or
by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,
you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit
permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.

The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License
give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or
imply endorsement of any Modified Version.


5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified
versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the
Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and
list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its
license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.

The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but
different contents, make the title of each such section unique by
adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original
author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number.
Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of
Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.

In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled "History"
in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled
"History"; likewise combine any sections Entitled "Acknowledgements",
and any sections Entitled "Dedications".  You must delete all sections
Entitled "Endorsements".


6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
documents released under this License, and replace the individual
copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy
that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the rules
of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents in all
other respects.

You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert a
copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this
License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that
document.


7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate
and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the copyright
resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights
of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit.
When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not
apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves
derivative works of the Document.

If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of
the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on
covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form.
Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole
aggregate.


8. TRANSLATION

Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4.
Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include
the original English version of this License and the original versions
of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a disagreement between
the translation and the original version of this License or a notice
or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.

If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements",
"Dedications", or "History", the requirement (section 4) to Preserve
its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual
title.


9. TERMINATION

You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void, and
will automatically terminate your rights under this License.

However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license
from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally,
unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally
terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder
fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to
60 days after the cessation.

Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
your receipt of the notice.

Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the same material does
not give you any rights to use it.


10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the
GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new versions
will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in
detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.

Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number.
If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this
License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of
following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or
of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the
Free Software Foundation.  If the Document does not specify a version
number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not
as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If the Document
specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of this
License can be used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a
version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the
Document.

11. RELICENSING

"Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site" (or "MMC Site") means any
World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also
provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works.  A
public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server.  A
"Massive Multiauthor Collaboration" (or "MMC") contained in the site
means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC site.

"CC-BY-SA" means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0
license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit
corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco,
California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license
published by that same organization.

"Incorporate" means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or in
part, as part of another Document.

An MMC is "eligible for relicensing" if it is licensed under this
License, and if all works that were first published under this License
somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently incorporated in whole or
in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover texts or invariant sections, and
(2) were thus incorporated prior to November 1, 2008.

The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the site
under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1, 2009,
provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.
