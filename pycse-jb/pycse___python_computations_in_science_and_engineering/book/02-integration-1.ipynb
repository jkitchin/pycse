    "1.  The formula was derived for n<sup>th</sup> order polynomials, here we had a 3rd order polynomial, so n-1 points are needed to exactly compute the integral. The formula is not exact for non-polynomial functions.\n",

This is a Python wrapper around a sophisticated [Fortran library](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QUADPACK) for integrating functions. These routines use an adaptive method to compute the integral and provide an upper bound on the error of the computed integral. The beauty of this interface is we can use a reliable, proven library written in Fortran inside of Python. We do not have to write and compile a Fortran program ourselves.\n",
