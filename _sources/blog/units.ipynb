    "It is a little tedious to do this, but we might only have to do it once if we store the new fsolve command in a module. You might notice the wrapped function we wrote above only works for one dimensional problems. If there are multiple dimensions, we have to be a little more careful. In the next example, we expand the wrapped function definition to do both one and multidimensional problems. It appears we cannot use numpy.array element-wise multiplication because you cannot mix units in an array. We will use lists instead. When the problem is one-dimensional, the function will take a scalar, but when it is multidimensional it will take a list or array. We will use try/except blocks to handle these two cases. We will assume multidimensional cases, and if that raises an exception because the argument is not a list, we assume it is scalar. Here is the more robust code example.\n",

    "That is not too bad. This is another example of a function you would want to save in a module for reuse. There is one bad feature of the wrapped odeint function, and that is that it changes the solution for coupled ODEs from an ndarray to a list. That is necessary because you apparently cannot have mixed units in an ndarray. It is fine, however, to have a list of mixed units. This is not a huge problem, but it changes the syntax for plotting results for the wrapped odeint function compared to the unwrapped function without units.\n",
