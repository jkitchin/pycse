    "Up to here, this is mostly review for us. It is just a nonlinear regression (admittedly to a strange looking function), and analysis of the resulting model. Note that the model is very flexible, and it can be used to fit a variety of other functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "I did not pull that model out of nowhere. Let's rewrite it in a few steps. If we think of `tanh` as a function that operates element-wise on a vector, we could write that equation more compactly at:\n",
    "\n",
    "                                  [w00 * x + b01]\n",

    "We can rewrite this one more time in matrix notation:\n",
    "\n",
    "    y = w1 @ np.tanh(w0 @ x + b0) + b1\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way to read these equations is that we have an input of $x$. We multiply the input by a vector weights ($\\mathbf{w0}$), add a vector of offsets (biases), $\\mathbf{b0}$, *activate* that by the nonlinear `tanh` function, then multiply that by a new set of weights, and add a final bias. We typically call this kind of model a *neural network*. There is an input layer, one hidden layer with 3 neurons that are activated by `tanh`, and one output layer with linear activation.\n",
    "\n",
    "A conventional graphical representation of this function as a neural network is shown here:\n",
    "![nn.png](./nn.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "These models are called neural networks because they were originally modeled after neurons. Neurons take input, and if the input is large enough the neuron is activated and has an output. The `tanh` function approximates this behavior in a smooth, differentiable way. Remarkably, neural networks have been shown to be universal function approximators and hence they are extremely useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you use a neural network, you have several choices to make:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  How many layers? Here we used one layer, but it is possible to have many layers where the output of the first layer goes to the second layer, etc.  This increases the flexibility of the network.\n",
    "2.  How many neurons should be in each layer? The more neurons you use, the more parameters there will be. This increases the flexibility of the network.\n",
    "3.  What activation function to use. The classics are tanh and sigmoid functions, but almost any nonlinear function can be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "In machine learning lingo, these choices are called *hyperparameters*. These are parameters that determine the size of the model, but they are fixed, and not fitted as part of the model. It is mostly *art and experience* that is how these choices are made. There are many advanced methods for doing this more systematically, but they are computationally expensive and beyond the scope of this class.\n",

    "In this section we consider another interpretation of what a neural network is. We start with a partial Fourier series expansion of a periodic function ([http://mathworld.wolfram.com/FourierSeries.html](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/FourierSeries.html)). This expansion can fit any even periodic function in the infinite limit, and can approximate that function otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "$f(x) = \\frac{1}{2} a_0 + \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} a_n \\cos(n x)$\n",
    "\n",
    "We use a partial series (leaving out the sin terms) just for simplicity of notation here. Next, we write this in a vector form. In the Fourier series, the $a_n$ have formal definitions: $a_n = \\int_{-\\pi}^{\\pi} f(x) cos(n x) dx$.  Let $\\mathbf{a} = [a_0, a_1, a_2, ..., a_n]$, and $\\mathbf{n} = [1, 2, .., n]$ Then, we can replace the sum as $\\mathbf{a} \\cdot \\cos(\\mathbf{n} x)$. We can for now imagine that $n$ could go to $\\infty$, but it is not critical; if we truncate the expansion, then we just have an approximate expansion.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get to a neural network, we relax a few things. First, we let $n$ take on continuous values that are determined by fitting, not just integer values. Second, we let $a_n$ become a fitting parameter, rather than computing it from the definition. Third, we allow other functions than $\\cos$ to \"activate\" the layers. In this sense, we can see that a single layer neural network is like an expansion in a basis set of the activation functions, with a more flexible definition of their form.\n",
    "\n",
    "A network can have multiple layers, and we interpret these as a composition of functions, e.g. f(g(x)), where the second layer serves to nonlinearly transform the output of the first layer.  Thus, \"deep learning\" provides a nonlinear transform of your input space to a new space with different dimensionality where the output is linear in this new space.\n",

    "The next function initializes the weights and biases for each layer in our network. It is standard practice to initialize them to small random numbers to avoid any unintentional symmetries that might occur from a systematic initialization (e.g. all ones or zeros). This code is kind of tricky, but it is very convenient. The size of the arrays are computable. For example, we have one input into a 3 neuron layer, which requires an array of three weights and three biases. Then these get combined back into one output, so we need  again three weights, but now only one bias. In a matrix multiply sense we have: (N, 1) @ (1, 3) @ (3, 1) = (N, 1). This function just automates building this even when there are multiple layers, inputs and outputs.\n",

    "Finally, we are ready to do some optimization. We use the [Adam optimizer](https://machinelearningmastery.com/adam-optimization-algorithm-for-deep-learning/). The details are not super important at this point, suffice to say it is a gradient descent algorithm. We use `autograd.grad` to provide that gradient of the objective function. One more important point here is the `step_size` argument. This is sometimes also called the *learning rate* in ML jargon. This parameter determines how fast the optimization converges. If it is too small, the rate of convergence is slow. If it is too large, then the convergence may not be stable. This is another *hyperparameter* that affects the model.\n",
