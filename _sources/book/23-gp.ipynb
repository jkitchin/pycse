That is we want the predicted value to be a weighted sum of the known points.  The key challenge is how to compute those weights.\n",

The integral is a kind of function, and surely if those special points were among our data points, we could just weight all the other points by 0 and achieve this goal.\n",

In GPR we make this idea quantitative.\n",

Intuitively, if two x-values are close together, then we anticipate that the corresponding $f(x)$ values are also close together. We can say that the values \"co-vary\", i.e. they are not independent. We use this fact when we integrate an ODE and estimate the next point, or in root solving when we iteratively find the next steps. We will use this idea to compute the weights that we need. The covariance is a matrix and each element of the matrix defines the covariance between two data points. To compute this, *we need to make some assumptions* about the data. A common assumption is that the covariance is Gaussian with the form:\n",

In other words, only data points within $2\\lambda$ distance units of a point will contribute to our estimate for that point.\n",
