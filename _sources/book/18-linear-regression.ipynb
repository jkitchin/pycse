    "In linear regression, we seek to find models in the form $y = a_{0} f_{0}(x) + a_{1} f_{1}(x) + ... + a_{n} f_{n}(x) + \\epsilon$, where $a_{i}$ are coefficients to be determined, and &epsilon; are the residual errors. We call this linear regression because the model is linear in the unknown coefficients $a_{i}$. The functions can be any function of $x$. In the function `numpy.polyfit` these functions are polynomials in $x$.\n",

    "If we are given some data as pairs of (x, y), we can construct a set of equations of the form:\n",

    "$\\mathbf{X} \\mathbf{a} = \\mathbf{y}$\n",

    "There are *usually* more data points than in the vector of $\\mathbf{a}$, so the shapes of these arrays are not suitable to solve directly. You can of course set up an objective function and use `scipy.optimize.minimize`, but there is a better approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "To be a little more specific, suppose we have $m$ pairs of $(x, y)$ data points, and we want to fit a model containing $n$ parameters. Then, the dimensions of the $\\mathbf{X}$ will be $(m, n)$, the dimensions of $\\mathbf{a}$ will be $(n, 1)$, and the dimensions of $\\mathbf{y}$ will be $(m, 1)$.  We have more equations than unknowns here, and we cannot use `numpy.linalg.solve` because \\mathbf{X} is not square. Note that if it was square, we would be doing the kind of interpolation we described in the last lecture.\n",

The right hand side $\\mathbf{X}^T \\mathbf{y}$ has a shape of $(n, m) * (m, 1) = (n, 1)$, and $\\mathbf{a}$ is still $(n, 1)$. This new matrix equation can be solved efficiently with `numpy.linalg.solve`.

    "You can see that by increasing &lambda; we are making more and more of the parameters go to zero; in other words the functions they correspond to are not part of the model any longer. This is called sparsifying the model. It reduces over-fitting by reducing the model complexity. Finding the most suitable value for &lambda; requires some sophisticated programming and analysis, and it is an important topic in machine learning and data science.\n",

    "LASSO has some important benefits, and some disadvantanges. The benefits include sparsification of the model; the method removes inputs that are not needed, or that are highly correlated with other inputs. This can make models more interpretable as there are fewer terms, and the terms are more independent.\n",

    "The disadvantages, however, are that we cannot use linear algebra to find the parameters. The penalty imposes a nonlinear behavior to the objective function, so we must use an iterative solver. For features that are correlated, we have no control over which feature is eliminated. Different initial guesses may lead to different feature elimination. If the features are really correlated, this will not affect the fit quality, but it will mean some models favor one feature over another. This is less of a problem in polynomial models, but often a problem in models based on physical properties that are correlated, e.g. high melting points of materials tend to be correlated with how hard they are. With LASSO, one model could favor the melting point and another could favor the hardness.\n",

    "A more advanced way to select a value of &lambda; is called k-fold validation. It is complex to code this, and the standard method to do it is in [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html), see specifically the [ridge regression example](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/linear_model.html#ridge-regression) and the  [LASSO example](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/linear_model.html#lasso). The basic idea is that you split your data set into $k$ *folds*, and then you fit $k-1$ folds to get the paramters. On the remaining fold (which was not used for fitting) you estimate the model errors. Initially with no regularization, the errors will be high due to overfitting. As you add regularization, the errors will begin decrease. Eventually though, the model will start underfitting, and the errors will go back up. The &lambda; that provides the lowest test errors is usually considered the best choice.\n",

    "In this lecture we introduced the concept of linear regression. In the normal linear regression, we simply solve linear equations that ultimately minimize the summed squared errors between the model and data. With some additional linear algebra, we can also estimate the confidence intervals on the parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "One issue with normal linear regression is that the parameters are unconstrained, which can lead to some functions having undesirably large parameters. We introduced two types of *regularization* to mitigate this issue: ridge regression and LASSO regression. In both cases, a penalty function is added to the objective function being minimized. In ridge regression the penalty is an L2 norm on the parameters which penalizes large parameters, leading to a reduction in their magnitude. In LASSO reduction the penalty is an L1 norm, which drives parameters towards zero. Both methods rely on a hyperparameter &lambda; that determines how much regularization is applied. With both regularization approaches we have to use some judgment in how much regularization to apply (the magnitude of &lambda;), and we only provided a heuristic approach to doing this.\n",
