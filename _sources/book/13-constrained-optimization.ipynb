    "`scipy.optimize.minimize` provides a convenient interface to solving a broad set of optimization problems both unconstrained and constrained. There is a significant body of knowledge hidden from us under this interface. For example there are 14 choices for different optimization algorithms in the interface, and the default one is chosen for you depending on arguments passed to it. It is easy to tell if the defaults are suitable; if you get a solution they are. If you don't get a solution, then you have to assess whether there is a solution, and whether a better algorithm would be appropriate. The details of these algorithms are the subject of dedicated courses in optimization.\n",
